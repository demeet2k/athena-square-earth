# 09 — Register Law and Machine Reading

## The Register Equations

### First Register Identity
```
4 x 3^3 = 108
```

Four elements times twenty-seven triadic states equals one hundred and eight. This is the organism's **dimensional ceiling** — the 108D crown-of-crowns that W9 activates. It is not arbitrary: it is the product of the quaternary base (4 elements, 4 seeds per position, 4 geometric modes) and the triadic body (3 families, 3 turns, 3 triads in the crown).

### Second Register Identity
```
4^4 x 3^3 = 6912
```

256 quaternary gates times 27 triadic states. This is the organism's **full gate count** — every possible combination of four quaternary choices and three triadic choices. 6912 = 256 x 27. The crystal side provides 256 addresses; the triadic side provides 27 modulations of each address.

### Third Register Identity (Machine Register)
```
16^16 x 9^9 = 2^64 x 3^18 = 256^8 x 27^6
```

This is the organism's **machine word**. Three equivalent factorizations reveal the hardware:

| Factorization | Reading |
|---------------|---------|
| 2^64 x 3^18 | 64-bit binary register paired with 18-trit triadic coprocessor |
| 256^8 x 27^6 | Eight bytes (crystal octave) paired with six triadic words (crown hexad) |
| 16^16 x 9^9 | Sixteen hex digits paired with nine nonary digits |

## The Dual Architecture

### Crystal Side: 64-bit Register

```
2^64 = 256^8
```

The crystal side is a standard 64-bit register. It addresses 2^64 states — the same as a modern processor word. But it is structured as 256^8: eight octaves of 256 gates each. Each gate is a 4^4 crystal address (four elements, each in one of four states). Eight octaves give the crystal its depth.

| Octave | Register Bits | Crystal Role |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | bits 0-7 | Foundation octave — seed addresses |
| 2 | bits 8-15 | Body octave — chapter addresses |
| 3 | bits 16-23 | Implementation octave — appendix addresses |
| 4 | bits 24-31 | Governance octave — canopy addresses |
| 5 | bits 32-39 | Emergent octave — crown addresses |
| 6 | bits 40-47 | Mirror octave — reverse-reading addresses |
| 7 | bits 48-55 | Weave octave — multi-object pattern addresses |
| 8 | bits 56-63 | Meta octave — self-referential addresses |

### Triadic Side: 18-trit Coprocessor

```
3^18 = 27^6
```

The triadic side is an 18-trit coprocessor. It addresses 3^18 states. Structured as 27^6: six triadic words of 27 states each. Each triadic word encodes a three-family choice at three levels: (Su/Me/Sa) x (Su/Me/Sa) x (Su/Me/Sa) = 27 states per word. Six words give the coprocessor its breadth.

| Word | Trits | Triadic Role |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | trits 0-2 | Seed family — which family governs the seed |
| 2 | trits 3-5 | Body family — which turn is active in the chapter body |
| 3 | trits 6-8 | Implementation family — which spoke is active |
| 4 | trits 9-11 | Governance family — which canopy arc is active |
| 5 | trits 12-14 | Crown family — which crown triad is active |
| 6 | trits 15-17 | Meta family — which family governs the self-reference |

## Canonical at Second Octave

The organism is **canonical at the second octave**: its natural operating point is octave 2 (bits 8-15, the body octave) paired with triadic word 2 (trits 3-5, the body family). This means:

- The first octave (seed) is below operating level — it is the foundation, always present but not directly manipulated during normal execution.
- The second octave (body) is the canonical execution level — this is where chapters are read, routes are compiled, and judgments are rendered.
- Octaves 3-8 are above operating level — they are reached through LIFT operations and returned from through DROP operations.

The second octave is where the organism lives. The first octave is where it comes from. Octaves 3-8 are where it reaches.

## The Weave Law

Higher-dimensional patterns are governed by **admissibility**, not mandatory symmetry.

### Validity Conditions

A weave pattern is valid if and only if:

| Condition | Requirement | Violation Mode |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Count Conserved** | The number of objects at every beat equals the number at the start. No object is created or destroyed by the weave. | Object loss or spontaneous generation |
| **Landings Collision-Free** | No two objects occupy the same site at the same beat. Every landing is unique. | Collision — two objects at one site |
| **Torsion Legality Preserved** | Every crossing of the Moebius boundary within the weave carries a valid Q/O certificate or stronger witness. | Uncertified torsion crossing |
| **Route Replayable** | The weave can be re-executed from its specification to produce the identical landing pattern. No randomness, no ambiguity. | Non-deterministic or ambiguous replay |

### What Is Not Required

- **Symmetry**: A weave need not be symmetric. Asymmetric patterns that satisfy all four conditions are fully legal.
- **Periodicity**: A weave need not repeat. Aperiodic patterns that satisfy all four conditions are fully legal.
- **Minimality**: A weave need not be the shortest possible pattern. Longer patterns that satisfy all four conditions are fully legal.
- **Elegance**: A weave need not be beautiful. Ugly patterns that satisfy all four conditions are fully legal.

The law is functional, not aesthetic. The organism does not judge its weaves by how they look — it judges them by whether they work.

## Siteswap Connection

The weave law is the organism's generalization of siteswap notation from juggling mathematics. In siteswap:

- Each number represents how many beats an object is airborne
- The average of the numbers equals the number of objects
- No two objects land at the same beat (collision-freedom)

The organism extends this to higher dimensions:

- Each opcode represents a move through the dimensional cascade
- Conservation replaces averaging (count must be exact, not average)
- Collision-freedom generalizes from beats to sites (multidimensional positions)
- Torsion legality adds a topological constraint absent from classical siteswap
- Replayability adds a determinism constraint

The weave law is siteswap lifted to 108 dimensions and equipped with torsion gates.
