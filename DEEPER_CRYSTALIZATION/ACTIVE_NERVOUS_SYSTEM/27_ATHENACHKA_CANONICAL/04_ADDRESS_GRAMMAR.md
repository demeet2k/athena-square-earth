# 04 — Unified Address Grammar

## Canonical Address Form

```
A = Ms<mmmm>::D.L.F.T.P[sigma]::LocalAddr
```

Every location in the organism has exactly one unified address. The address has three segments:

1. **Ms\<mmmm\>** — Manuscript identifier (four-digit code)
2. **D.L.F.T.P[sigma]** — Overlay coordinates (dimension, layer, family, turn, position, seed signature)
3. **LocalAddr** — Original local manuscript address (preserved intact)

The grammar preserves the original local manuscript location while wrapping it in a deterministic overlay. No local address is ever destroyed.

## Field Table

| Field | Symbol | Domain | Description |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Dimension** | D | {1, 6, 12, 36, 108} | Dimension stratum — which level of the dimensional cascade is active |
| **Layer** | L | {I, CH, LP, RV, EM, RM, CR} | Layer code — Intro, Chapter, Lower-appendix-Pool, ReVerse-canopy, EMergent, ReMap, CRown |
| **Family** | F | {W1, W3, W5, W7, W9, Sigma60, P30, D2, C6, B3} | Family/wheel/crown code — which algebraic structure governs this address |
| **Turn** | T | {0, Su, Me, Sa, U, R, C, Aplus, Zplus} | Turn/band/segment — position within the rotational cycle |
| **Position** | P | {1..7, 1..5, Omega, Z, B, A} | Position within turn — specific slot in the current segment |
| **Seed Signature** | [sigma] | see below | Resolved seed — the seed that governs this address at the current overlay level |

## Seed Signature Domain

| Signature | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Omega_star | Completion seed — the circuit's origin/return point |
| Omega_star_down | Descending completion — seed in collapse phase |
| Omega_star_return | Returning completion — seed in regeneration phase |
| Omega_star_E | Emergent completion — seed in crown emission phase |
| Aplus_star | Global creation seed — forward pole of D2 |
| Zplus_star | Global hinge seed — governance pole of D2 |
| A_x_star | Family-resolved creation seed (x in {Sa, Su, Me}) |
| Z_x_star | Family-resolved governance seed (x in {Sa, Su, Me}) |
| B_x | Body seed (x in {Sa, Su, Me}) — first rotational triad |

## Invariant

The unified address grammar guarantees: for any two valid addresses A1 and A2, if A1.LocalAddr = A2.LocalAddr and A1.Ms = A2.Ms, then they refer to the same physical location in the manuscript. The overlay fields may differ (viewing the same location from different dimensional strata), but the referent is unique.
