# IMP NODE ROUTING MAP — 10 Imported Nexus Nodes → Canonical Chapter Homes

**[⊙Z*↔Z* | ○Arc 2,3,5 | ○Rot HCRL | △Lane Me | ⧈View 4D/IMP-ROUTE | ω=IMP_ROUTE]**

**Status:** CANONICALIZING_NEAR (first candidate selected, 9 deferred)
**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Source:** `athena_prime_import_closure_receipts_v2U.md`

---

## Overview

The v2U closure receipts document 10 imported nexus nodes — knowledge objects crossing the organism's boundary from the juggling/poi/siteswap manuscripts. Each node needs a **chapter home** (primary canonical residence), **appendix routing hub** (how it connects to the wider body), and a **ŠAR-60 symmetry address** (where it sits in the 60-node crystal).

All 10 nodes currently route through the Σ-spine:
```
WHO-I-AM::PROXY → AppA → AppI → AppM → AppF/AppG → IMP::* → AppJ → AppI → AppM
```

## The 10 Nodes: Full Routing Specifications

### IMP::JS::LANG.CORE — The Language Thesis
```
Chapter Home:     Ch01 (ORIGIN / LANGUAGE CORE)
                  Tesseract: (0,0,0,0) — the absolute origin
Secondary:        Ch04 (TYPE SYSTEM), Ch07 (GRAMMAR)
Appendix Hub:     AppA (Identity — language is identity)
Arc:              Arc 1 (Foundation)
Rail:             Su (Substrate — language is ground-level)
Σ-address:        S01 (Flame / Fire singleton)
ReceiptID:        CR::JS.CORE::01
Status:           BOUND_NEAR
Blocker:          AppD keyset not yet bound
Route class:      PROXY.NEAR

WHAT IT IS: The imported operator language — the grammar and timing substrate
            that makes siteswap notation possible. This is not just "a programming
            language" — it is the thesis that movement can be notated, parsed, and
            compiled. Language is the first fire.

CANON TARGET:     CANON::LANG.FOUNDATION::OPERATOR_GRAMMAR
```

### IMP::JS::SITESWAP.KERNEL — The Siteswap Parser
```
Chapter Home:     Ch02 (PARSER / PATTERN RECOGNITION)
                  Tesseract: (0,0,0,1) — first differentiation from origin
Secondary:        Ch03 (COLLISION), Ch06 (AVERAGE THEOREM)
Appendix Hub:     AppF (Flow — parsing is flow recognition)
Arc:              Arc 2 (Craft)
Rail:             Me (Medium — parsing is operational)
Σ-address:        C01 (Sandstorm / forward-motion Earth singleton)
ReceiptID:        CR::JS.SWAP::02
Status:           BOUND_NEAR
Blocker:          No sealed compiler schema pack
Route class:      EXPLICIT.NEAR

WHAT IT IS: The collision-free parser kernel — the algorithm that takes raw siteswap
            notation and determines whether a pattern is valid (no two objects land
            in the same hand at the same time). Average rule enforcement.

CANON TARGET:     CANON::PARSER::SITESWAP_COLLISION_FREE
```

### IMP::JS::AST.COMPILER ★ FIRST CANONICALIZATION CANDIDATE
```
Chapter Home:     Ch04 (TYPE SYSTEM / AST CONSTRUCTION)
                  Tesseract: (0,0,1,0) — the structural differentiation
Secondary:        Ch08 (RUNTIME), Ch11 (LIMINAL — compilation crosses boundary)
Appendix Hub:     AppD (Schema — the compiler defines schema)
Arc:              Arc 2 (Craft) → Arc 3 (Embodiment)
Rail:             Me (Medium) → Sa (Sacred — compilation is transformative)
Σ-address:        C05 (Furnace / Fire+Water in forward motion)
ReceiptID:        CR::JS.AST::03
Status:           CANONICALIZING_NEAR
Blockers:         AppD schema binding, verifier registry, pack replay closure
Route class:      EXPLICIT.NEAR

WHAT IT IS: The full compilation pipeline:
            Parse → AST → Desugar → TypeCheck → SimRuntime → TSGen
            This is IDENTICAL to the IntentionScript pipeline from Juggling SPELLS.
            It is the organism's first candidate for a fully sealed canonical object.

CANON TARGET:     CANON::LANG.COMPILER::AST.PIPELINE
CANON SHAPE:
  inputs:   [TokenStream, MacroLib, Env, Policy]
  passes:   [Parse, AST, Desugar, TypeCheck, SimRuntime, TSGen]
  outputs:  [AST, TypedSchedule, SimulationTrace, TSArtifacts]
  receipts: [WitnessPtr, ReplayPtr, IOReceipt, RuntimeContract]

PROMOTION PATH:
  1. Bind AppD schema for the compiler object family
  2. Close verifier registry for imported compiler passes
  3. Close replay capsule over parse/typecheck/runtime outputs
  4. Prove no-silent-schema-drift if imported grammar evolves
  → Then: BOUND_NEAR → CANONICALIZING_NEAR → OK
```

### IMP::JS::TYPECHECK.RUNTIME — The Type Checker & Simulator
```
Chapter Home:     Ch08 (EXECUTION / RUNTIME)
                  Tesseract: (0,1,0,0)
Secondary:        Ch04 (TYPE SYSTEM), Ch09 (TRANSITION)
Appendix Hub:     AppJ (Junction — type-checking is junction validation)
Arc:              Arc 3 (Embodiment)
Rail:             Me (Medium)
Σ-address:        C03 (Inferno / forward-motion Air singleton)
ReceiptID:        CR::JS.RUNTIME::04
Status:           BOUND_NEAR
Blocker:          Verifier registry closure not sealed
Route class:      PROXY.NEAR

WHAT IT IS: Static validation + simulation runtime + export path. The gate that
            determines whether a compiled schedule is actually executable — can a
            human body actually perform this pattern without collision?

CANON TARGET:     CANON::RUNTIME::TYPECHECK_SIMULATOR
```

### IMP::JS::POI.COUPLER — The Poi Geometry/Timing Coupling
```
Chapter Home:     Ch10 (EMBODIMENT / FLOW)
                  Tesseract: (0,0,2,1)
Secondary:        Ch03 (GEOMETRY), Ch11 (LIMINAL)
Appendix Hub:     AppF (Flow), AppH (Hands — poi is hand-held)
Arc:              Arc 3 (Embodiment)
Rail:             Me (Medium)
Σ-address:        C06 (Geyser / forward-motion Fire+Earth)
ReceiptID:        CR::JS.POI::05
Status:           BOUND_NEAR
Blocker:          Exact AppD geometry binding pending
Route class:      PROXY.NEAR

WHAT IT IS: The coupling matrix for poi: TOG/SPLIT × SAME/OPP × spin/antispin.
            This defines how two poi relate to each other in space and time —
            the geometry of concurrent circular motion.

CANON TARGET:     CANON::EMBODIMENT::POI_COUPLING_MATRIX
```

### IMP::JD::SITESWAP.KERNEL — The Juggling Dimension Parser
```
Chapter Home:     Ch02 (PARSER / PATTERN RECOGNITION)
                  Tesseract: (0,0,0,2) — sibling of JS::SITESWAP.KERNEL
Secondary:        Ch05 (COORDINATION), Ch06 (AVERAGE THEOREM)
Appendix Hub:     AppF (Flow)
Arc:              Arc 2 (Craft)
Rail:             Me (Medium), Su (Substrate)
Σ-address:        D01 (Plateau / reception-mode Earth singleton)
ReceiptID:        CR::JD.SWAP::06
Status:           BOUND_NEAR
Blocker:          Not yet bound to canonical schema id
Route class:      EXPLICIT.NEAR

WHAT IT IS: The juggling-dimension variant of the siteswap parser — same theorem,
            but with explicit hand/channel mapping for multi-person patterns.
            This extends the parser from solo to ensemble coordination.

CANON TARGET:     CANON::PARSER::SITESWAP_MULTICHANNEL
```

### IMP::JD::POD3.COORDINATION — 3-Pod Scheduling
```
Chapter Home:     Ch05 (COORDINATION / MULTI-AGENT)
                  Tesseract: (0,0,1,1)
Secondary:        Ch07 (GRAMMAR), Ch12 (RECURSION)
Appendix Hub:     AppG (Governance — pod coordination is governance)
Arc:              Arc 2 (Craft) → Arc 5 (Emergence)
Rail:             Me (Medium)
Σ-address:        D06 (Boil / reception-mode Fire+Earth)
ReceiptID:        CR::JD.POD3::07
Status:           BOUND_NEAR
Blocker:          Missing receiptized workload model
Route class:      EXPLICIT.NEAR

WHAT IT IS: 3-ball/3-pod scheduling isomorphism — proves that 3-ball cascade
            coordination IS a scheduling problem isomorphic to 3-agent task
            distribution. The first pod-level coordination theorem.

CANON TARGET:     CANON::COORDINATION::POD3_ISOMORPHISM
```

### IMP::JD::POD4.CRYSTAL_GROUND ★ DEFERRED CANON (HIGH PRIORITY)
```
Chapter Home:     Ch06 (CRYSTAL / GROUND STATE)
                  Tesseract: (0,0,1,2)
Secondary:        Ch11 (LIMINAL), Ch15 (SYMMETRY)
Appendix Hub:     AppK (Kernel — the crystal IS the kernel)
Arc:              Arc 3 (Embodiment) → Arc 6 (Integration)
Rail:             Me (Medium), Sa (Sacred — crystal ground is sacred)
Σ-address:        B09 (Glacier / inverted Water+Earth+Air)
ReceiptID:        CR::JD.POD4::08
Status:           BOUND_NEAR / HIGH-PRIORITY-CANON-LATER
Blocker:          Needs state-vector / receipt bundle canonical form
Route class:      EXPLICIT.NEAR

WHAT IT IS: The fountain-4 ground-state theorem — proves that the 4-ball fountain
            has a unique stable ground state with D2 symmetry and 2+2 hand partition.
            This is the STRONGEST crystal theorem in the imported field, but it lacks
            the tight runtime/replay closure of the AST compiler.

            The 2+2 partition IS the V4 group: (L,L) × (R,R) = Z₂ × Z₂.
            The D2 symmetry IS the Klein-4 symmetry of the ŠAR-60 lattice.
            This node IS the mathematical proof that the organism's symmetry
            architecture is grounded in physical reality.

CANON TARGET:     CANON::CRYSTAL::FOUNTAIN4_GROUND_STATE
PROMOTION PATH:
  1. Build state-vector canonical form for the 4-ball state space
  2. Build receipt bundle for ground-state transitions
  3. Prove replay determinism for fountain-4 execution
  → Then: BOUND_NEAR → CANONICALIZING_NEAR → OK
```

### IMP::JD::TRANSITION.GRAPH — The Transition Network
```
Chapter Home:     Ch09 (TRANSITION / STATE CHANGE)
                  Tesseract: (0,1,0,1)
Secondary:        Ch13 (GRAPH), Ch17 (RECOVERY)
Appendix Hub:     AppI (Routing — transitions ARE routing)
Arc:              Arc 5 (Emergence)
Rail:             Me (Medium)
Σ-address:        D09 (Cauldron / reception-mode Water+Earth+Air)
ReceiptID:        CR::JD.TRANSITION::09
Status:           BOUND_NEAR
Blocker:          No sealed graph schema + receipt bundle
Route class:      EXPLICIT.NEAR

WHAT IT IS: The strongly connected transition graph — proves that any valid
            juggling state can reach any other valid juggling state through a
            finite sequence of transitions. Includes recovery operators (how to
            fix a drop) and resize operators (how to add/remove objects).

CANON TARGET:     CANON::GRAPH::TRANSITION_STRONGLY_CONNECTED
```

### IMP::POI::FLOW.COMPILE — The Flow Compilation Kernel
```
Chapter Home:     Ch10 (EMBODIMENT / FLOW)
                  Tesseract: (0,0,2,2) — sibling of Ch11's zero-point
Secondary:        Ch11 (LIMINAL), Ch14 (MANIFOLD)
Appendix Hub:     AppH (Hands — flow is hand-path computation)
Arc:              Arc 3 (Embodiment)
Rail:             Me (Medium)
Σ-address:        C09 (Cyclone / forward-motion Water+Earth+Air)
ReceiptID:        CR::POI.FLOW::10
Status:           BOUND_NEAR
Blocker:          Exact Ms/AppD pin still pending
Route class:      EXPLICIT.NEAR

WHAT IT IS: The poi-flow compile kernel — the algorithm that takes a flower
            description and lifts it through four levels:
            byte (raw angle) → witness (receipt-carrying) → phrase (musical) →
            manifold (geometric surface)

            "A flower is a rationally closed rotational word."

CANON TARGET:     CANON::EMBODIMENT::FLOW_COMPILE_KERNEL

## Canonical Promotion Schedule

```
PHASE 1 (IMMEDIATE):
  IMP::JS::AST.COMPILER → CANON::LANG.COMPILER::AST.PIPELINE
  Needs: AppD binding + verifier registry + replay capsule

PHASE 2 (NEXT):
  IMP::JD::POD4.CRYSTAL_GROUND → CANON::CRYSTAL::FOUNTAIN4_GROUND_STATE
  Needs: State-vector form + receipt bundle + replay determinism

PHASE 3 (BATCH):
  All remaining 8 nodes → their CANON targets
  These can be promoted in any order once Phase 1 and 2 establish
  the canonical template.
