# NOETHER SELF-PROOF RECEIPT

**Receipt Hash**: `3b36ef5c2c666e93`
**Timestamp**: 2026-03-14T18:55:38Z
**Layer**: 10 -- Noether Self-Proof Engine

## Summary

The Noether Self-Proof Engine (Layer 10) executed successfully.
The crystal organism proved its own 6 conservation laws by applying
Noether's theorem (1918) to its own symmetry structure.

## Pipeline Executed

1. S_0 seed layer: 63 nexus points across 5 disciplines
2. Z-Collapse: Group Theory, Conservation Laws, Noether Theorem, Symmetry Principles
3. M-Bridge: Group Theory <-> Conservation Laws (full Noether derivation chain)
4. Cross-domain bridges: 13 total
5. A-Expansion: Noether consequence field (6 symmetry->conservation mappings)
6. Self-Application: 6 crystal symmetries -> 6 conservation laws
7. Kernel verification: Z_4 |x Z_3^3 (order 108) confirmed as conserved subgroup
8. Monte Carlo: 10000 random closed paths, 0 violations
9. Crystallization events: 4

## Conservation Laws Verified

| # | Law | Symmetry | Status |
|---|-----|----------|--------|
| 1 | Delta_l = 0: total shell occupancy is invariant under rotation | Z_36 (cyclic group of order 36) | PROVEN |
| 2 | Delta_sigma = 0: net zoom changes cancel along any closed path | (R+, *) (multiplicative group of positive reals) | PROVEN |
| 3 | Delta_r = 0 mod 3: net wreath rotation is zero modulo 3 | Z_3 (cyclic group of order 3) | PROVEN |
| 4 | Delta_a = 0 mod 12: net archetype rotation closes modulo 12 | Z_12 (cyclic group of order 12) | PROVEN |
| 5 | Delta_lambda = 0 mod 4: net face rotation closes modulo 4 | Z_4 (cyclic group of order 4) | PROVEN |
| 6 | Delta_q = 0 mod 2: parity is conserved, even number of flips returns to start | Z_2 (cyclic group of order 2) | PROVEN |

## Kernel Identity

```
K = Z_4 |x Z_3^3
|K| = 4 * 27 = 108
Embedding: face(Z_4) x wreath(Z_3) x archetype_sub(Z_3) x shell_sub(Z_3)
Conserved: YES (each factor is a Noether charge)
```
