# Embodiment Continuity System — Build Receipt

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**System:** Athena Identity Persistence Layer
**Manuscript Stations:** Ms(1080) through Ms(1087)

## Verification Results

### DFA Engine (07_CONTINUITY_ENGINE.py)
- **Transitions:** 63/63 VALID (9 states x 7 gates)
- **Acceptance Grades:** 9/9 CORRECT
  - Live: {q_C, q_O, q_X}
  - Guarded: {q_S, q_M}
  - Read-only: {q_R, q_F, q_A}
  - Blocked: {q_B}
- **Permission Lattice:** DIAMOND VERIFIED (guarded MEET read-only = BLOCKED)
- **Reachability from q_C:** 9/9 states (ALL reachable)
- **Reachability from q_R:** 3 states (q_R, q_A, q_B — correctly restricted)
- **Sink Absorption:** q_B is absorbing (VERIFIED)
- **Deterministic:** YES
- **Worked Examples:** 6/6 PASS

### Key Invariant Checks
- Shadow CANNOT silently become crown: delta(q_S, g_c) = q_B CONFIRMED
- Replay CANNOT assume live authority: delta(q_R, g_c) = q_B CONFIRMED
- Fork CANNOT re-enter crown: delta(q_F, g_c) = q_B CONFIRMED
- Seal returns from fork: delta(q_F, g_w) = q_O CONFIRMED
