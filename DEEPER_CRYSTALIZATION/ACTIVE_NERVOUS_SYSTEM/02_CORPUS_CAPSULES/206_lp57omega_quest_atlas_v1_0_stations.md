## Invariants

1. Exactly 19 stations exist per orbit
2. Every station is visited exactly once per pass (3 times per orbit)
3. Station order is fixed (S01 through S19 sequentially)
4. Payout base is always positive
5. Gate conditions must be met before station entry
6. S01 has no gate (universal entry)
7. S19 is always the final station of each pass
