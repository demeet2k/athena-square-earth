Expected: All routes have total_hubs <= 6
Test:
  for each candidate c in maxhub_set:
    route = compile_route(normalize_candidate(c))
    total = len(route.sigma) + bool(route.lens_hub) \
          + bool(route.overlay) + bool(route.publish_hub)
    assert total <= 6
    if trimmed: assert len(route.droplog) > 0

## Verifier Execution

### Running the Verifier

```
Entry point: verifier.py

Usage:
  python -m verifier --all          # Run all 15 vectors
  python -m verifier --category 1   # Run category 1 only
  python -m verifier --vector V05   # Run single vector

Output format:
  [PASS] V01 route_sigma_lock         (0.003s)
  [PASS] V02 route_hub_budget         (0.002s)
  ...
  [PASS] V15 orbit_level_decomposition (0.001s)

  ════════════════════════════════
  RESULT: 15/15 PASSED
  STATUS: CERTIFIED
  ════════════════════════════════
```

### Release Certification Gate

```
CERTIFY_RELEASE(bundle):
  1. Load BundleManifest.v1
  2. Verify bundle integrity (all policies present, hashes match)
  3. Run all 15 golden test vectors
  4. If 15/15 PASS:
       emit CERTIFICATION_RECEIPT
       status = CERTIFIED
       release_allowed = True
  5. If < 15 PASS:
       emit FAILURE_REPORT (list failed vectors)
       status = REJECTED
       release_allowed = False
  6. Log result to ledger

  CERTIFICATION_RECEIPT contains:
    - bundle_hash
    - vector_results (15 entries)
    - timestamp
    - verifier_version
    - chain_hash (links to previous certification)
```

## Deterministic Replay

All vectors support deterministic replay:

```
REPLAY(vector_id):
  1. Load vector input from canonical dataset
  2. Execute vector test function
  3. Compare output against expected result
  4. Output is binary: PASS or FAIL
  5. No randomness, no external dependencies
  6. Same hardware, same result. Different hardware, same result.
```

Critical vectors (13 of 15) are mandatory for release. Non-critical vectors are advisory.

## Invariants

1. All 15 vectors must pass for release certification
2. Vectors are deterministic (no randomness)
3. Vector inputs are canonical and version-controlled
4. Vector expected outputs are fixed at specification time
5. The verifier itself is deterministic
6. Certification receipts form a hash chain
7. Any vector failure blocks release
