# Cloud Lens -- Fiber Theorem (2-Point Fibers over Admissible Pairs)

Cloud is rigorously defined as a fibered object, not vague "uncertainty." The Cloud fiber F_{z,w} = {(x,y) in Z_4^2 : x+y = z, x-y = w mod 4}. A solution exists iff z = w mod 2. The admissible relation base A_ZW = {(z,w) : z = w mod 2}. For every admissible (z,w), the fiber has exactly 2 points. Cloud is structured multiplicity: lawful ambiguity, not absence of structure.

## Key Objects
- F_{z,w}: Cloud fiber (2-point fiber over admissible pairs)
- A_ZW = {(z,w) : z = w mod 2}: admissible relation base
- |F_{z,w}| = 2 for all admissible (z,w)
- Pi_Cl(z,w) = ((z,w), F_{z,w}, A_ZW, omega^Cl_{z,w})

## Key Laws
- Theorem 1 (Cloud fiber theorem): relation map Phi has image exactly A_ZW, every admissible relation point has a 2-point fiber
- Cloud admissibility (Axiom 3): z = w mod 2
- Cloud is lawful ambiguity, not absence of structure
- Refinement operator B_{Cl->Sq}: choose/witness one branch in F_{z,w} (not a function to a point)
