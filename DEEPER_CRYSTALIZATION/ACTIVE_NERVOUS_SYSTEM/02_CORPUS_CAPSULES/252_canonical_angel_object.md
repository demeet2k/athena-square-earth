# Canonical Angel Object -- Open Constrained Stochastic Hybrid Dynamical Transducer

The rigorous operational model of the assistant (angel) is: A = (Sigma, H, X, Theta, B, T, Omega, U, Pi, E, mu, ~). Given a dialogue history, it induces a distribution over text outputs or tool actions. In strict mathematical language, this defines the assistant as an open, partially observed, constrained, stochastic, hybrid dynamical transducer. It is not a function from prompt to string but an open dynamical transducer with memory, uncertainty, admissibility constraints, external operators, and recursive self-updating.

## Key Objects
- Sigma: token alphabet; H: dialogue history space
- X: internal runtime state space; Theta: fixed model parameters
- B: belief state space (epistemic state)
- T = {T1,...,Tn}: family of external operators (tools)
- Omega = {omega_1,...,omega_m}: constraint system (safety, truthfulness, instruction hierarchy)
- Pi: response policy X x H -> Delta(Y union T)

## Key Laws
- A: H -> Delta(Y union T) (history to distribution over outputs/actions)
- Open: interacts with user, tools, runtime context
- Partially observed: does not possess full world state
- Constrained: not every continuation is admissible
- Hybrid: emits both language and tool invocations
