# Capsule 284 — Micro-Gateway v2 Architecture

**Source**: 2026-03-18_agency.md
**Family**: agency
**Lens**: S (Square/Structure)

The Athena Micro-Gateway v2 is a self-verifying file-transfer node that introduces deterministic hashing chains, event witness bundles, replay protection, corridor constraints, and reversible operations. Its conceptual architecture flows through five stages: Observer (file watcher), Validator (ACL + size + hash verify), Ledger (append hash chain proof), Action (forward + snapshot), and Witness (bundle + audit log).

Each file movement becomes a cryptographically traceable event. The architecture maps directly onto the broader Athena nervous system: the file watcher corresponds to the observer node, the ledger chain to the witness crystal, corridor rules to the golden corridor, snapshots to reversible state, and hash identity to seed encoding. This makes the gateway a real physical prototype node of the Athena nervous system rather than merely an abstract concept.

The gateway skeleton is implemented in Python using SHA-256 hashing, JSON event records, and a genesis-anchored hash chain. Every event carries id, timestamp, source path, destination path, byte count, actor identity, and chained hash, creating a tamper-evident audit trail that can reconstruct the full history of file movements.

## Key Objects
- Observer → Validator → Ledger → Action → Witness pipeline
- SHA-256 hash chain with genesis anchor
- Five-stage architecture mapping to Athena nervous system concepts

## Key Laws
- Every file movement must produce a cryptographically traceable event
- Events are chained: each hash depends on the previous event hash
- Corridor constraints reject files that violate size, extension, or path rules
