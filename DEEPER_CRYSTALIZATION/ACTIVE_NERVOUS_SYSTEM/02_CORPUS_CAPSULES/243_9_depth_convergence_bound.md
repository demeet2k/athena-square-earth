# 9-Depth Convergence Bound and Proof

The 9-depth convergence bound (Ch16, Theorem 16.3.1) is proved twice: by damping (|w|^9 < 1/pi) and by the norm constraint (sqrt(1 - 1/pi^2) > 1 - 1/pi). The bound establishes that any trajectory governed by the crystal operator converges within at most 9 recursive depth levels. Appendix K provides the complete self-contained proof.

## Key Objects
- Convergence bound: 9 depth levels maximum
- Damping proof: |w|^9 = (1/sqrt(2))^9 < 1/pi
- Norm proof: sqrt(1 - 1/pi^2) > 1 - 1/pi
- Convergence fraction: 68.5% approximately 1 - 1/pi of all initial conditions converge to Z*
- Thin-slice accuracy at O(1) complexity
- Appendix K: complete self-contained proof

## Key Laws
- |w|^9 < 1/pi (damping bound)
- 68.5% approximately 1 - 1/pi convergence rate
- 31.5% approximately 1/pi of initial conditions do NOT converge
- The 9 emergent chapters (E1-E9) match the 9 depth levels exactly
