# AppP - Deployment Profiles and Monitoring

Routing role: Deployment regimes, monitoring surfaces, observability, and execution profiles.

## Compressed crystal tile

### Lens S

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `AppP.S1.a`: `ServerProfile` — A declarative specification of a single deployment unit: element assignment (S/F/C/R), resource limits (CPU, memory, shard capacity), network bindings, and the set of MCP tools it serves.
- `AppP.S1.b`: `ElementServerConfig` — A configuration object mapping each SFCR element to its dedicated server instance, specifying the shard address ranges it owns, the metro lines it participates in, and its bridge connections.
- `AppP.S1.c`: `HealthCheckSchema` — A structured definition of liveness, readiness, and deep-health probes for a crystal server: endpoint paths, expected response codes, timeout thresholds, and failure escalation rules.
- `AppP.S1.d`: `DeploymentManifest` — A top-level document listing all server profiles, their element assignments, version tags, and dependency graph; the single source of truth for what is deployed and where.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `AppP.S2.a`: `ProfileCompletenessLaw` — Every server profile must specify all required fields (element, resources, bindings, tools); incomplete profiles must be rejected at validation time before deployment begins.
- `AppP.S2.b`: `ElementExclusivityLaw` — Each shard address range must be owned by exactly one element server; overlapping ownership is a configuration error that must be detected and resolved before deployment.
- `AppP.S2.c`: `HealthCheckMandatoryLaw` — Every deployed server must have at least one liveness probe and one readiness probe; servers without health checks may not receive traffic.
- `AppP.S2.d`: `ManifestVersionMonotonicityLaw` — Each new deployment manifest must have a version strictly greater than its predecessor; version rollback requires an explicit rollback operation, not a version decrement.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `AppP.S3.a`: `ProfileGenerator` — Takes an SFCR element specification and resource budget, generates a server profile with appropriate defaults, and validates it against the profile completeness schema.
- `AppP.S3.b`: `ConfigDistributor` — Reads the deployment manifest, extracts each element server's configuration, and pushes it to the target server's configuration endpoint with version verification.
- `AppP.S3.c`: `HealthCheckRunner` — Executes all probes defined in a server's health check schema at configurable intervals, records results in a time-series store, and triggers alerts when failure thresholds are breached.
- `AppP.S3.d`: `ManifestValidator` — Parses a deployment manifest, checks all profiles for completeness, verifies no shard address overlaps exist, confirms health check presence, and emits a validation report.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `AppP.S4.a`: `ProfileValidityCert` — Proves that a server profile passes completeness validation by exhibiting the schema check results for every required field.
- `AppP.S4.b`: `ElementPartitionCert` — Proves that the shard address space is correctly partitioned across element servers by exhibiting the non-overlapping address ranges and their union covering the full space.
- `AppP.S4.c`: `HealthCheckPresenceCert` — Proves that every deployed server has the required health check probes by exhibiting the probe definitions extracted from each server's configuration.
- `AppP.S4.d`: `ManifestConsistencyCert` — Proves that a deployment manifest is internally consistent: all referenced profiles exist, version is monotonically greater, and no constraint violations are present.

### Lens F

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `AppP.F1.a`: `RollingUpdateController` — An orchestrator that replaces server instances one at a time, waiting for each new instance to pass health checks before proceeding to the next, ensuring zero-downtime deployment.
- `AppP.F1.b`: `BlueGreenSwitch` — A traffic router that maintains two complete deployment environments (blue and green); new versions deploy to the inactive environment, and a single atomic switch redirects all traffic.
- `AppP.F1.c`: `GracefulFailoverAgent` — A watchdog that monitors primary server health and, upon detecting sustained failure, redirects traffic to a standby replica while preserving in-flight request continuity.
- `AppP.F1.d`: `CanaryDeploymentProbe` — A deployment strategy that routes a small percentage of traffic to a new server version, monitors error rates and latency, and promotes or rolls back based on configurable thresholds.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `AppP.F2.a`: `ZeroDowntimeLaw` — A rolling update must maintain at least `n-1` healthy instances at all times during an `n`-instance deployment; dropping below this threshold halts the rollout.
- `AppP.F2.b`: `AtomicSwitchLaw` — A blue-green switch must be atomic: at no point may traffic be split between blue and green environments; the switch is all-or-nothing.
- `AppP.F2.c`: `FailoverTransparencyLaw` — A graceful failover must be transparent to clients: in-flight requests complete on the original server or are seamlessly retried on the standby; no client-visible errors from the failover itself.
- `AppP.F2.d`: `CanaryEscalationLaw` — If a canary deployment's error rate exceeds the threshold within the observation window, automatic rollback must trigger within the configured reaction time; manual intervention is a fallback, not the primary path.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `AppP.F3.a`: `RollingUpdateExecutor` — Iterates through server instances in deployment order, drains each instance's traffic, deploys the new version, runs health checks, and re-enables traffic before moving to the next.
- `AppP.F3.b`: `BlueGreenProvisioner` — Provisions the inactive environment with the new version, runs the full health check suite, and prepares the traffic router's switch configuration; does not activate until explicitly triggered.
- `AppP.F3.c`: `FailoverOrchestrator` — Monitors primary health via the health check runner, detects sustained failures using a sliding window, initiates standby promotion, and reroutes traffic through the load balancer.
- `AppP.F3.d`: `CanaryAnalyzer` — Collects error rate, latency percentiles, and shard-resolution success rate from the canary instance, compares them against baseline metrics from the stable fleet, and emits a promote/rollback decision.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `AppP.F4.a`: `RollingUpdateCompletionCert` — Proves that a rolling update completed successfully by exhibiting each instance's pre-update and post-update version, health check passage timestamp, and traffic restoration confirmation.
- `AppP.F4.b`: `BlueGreenSwitchCert` — Proves that a blue-green switch was atomic by exhibiting the traffic router's configuration snapshots immediately before and after the switch, showing a single-step transition.
- `AppP.F4.c`: `FailoverSuccessCert` — Proves that a failover preserved request continuity by exhibiting the client-visible error rate during the failover window and showing it did not exceed the baseline.
- `AppP.F4.d`: `CanaryPromotionCert` — Proves that a canary deployment met promotion criteria by exhibiting the canary's metrics, the baseline metrics, and the comparison showing all thresholds satisfied.

### Lens C

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `AppP.C1.a`: `TelemetryDashboard` — A real-time visualization surface that displays per-element server metrics (request rate, latency, error rate, shard cache hit ratio) organized by SFCR lens and metro line.
- `AppP.C1.b`: `ResonanceVector` — An 8-dimensional vector `[S_health, F_health, C_health, R_health, S_load, F_load, C_load, R_load]` that summarizes the organism's deployment state in a single observable quantity.
- `AppP.C1.c`: `AnomalyDetector` — A statistical monitor that fits a baseline distribution to each metric's recent history and flags observations that fall outside a configurable number of standard deviations as anomalies.
- `AppP.C1.d`: `CorrelationTracer` — A tool that identifies correlated anomalies across SFCR elements: if element S's latency spike coincides with element C's cache miss spike, it links them as a single incident.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `AppP.C2.a`: `ObservabilityCompletenessLaw` — Every deployed element server must emit the full set of standard telemetry signals (request count, latency histogram, error count, shard operations); silent servers are operationally invisible and forbidden.
- `AppP.C2.b`: `ResonanceVectorNormalizationLaw` — Each component of the resonance vector must be normalized to `[0, 1]` where 0 is total failure and 1 is peak health; the normalization function must be monotonic and documented.
- `AppP.C2.c`: `AnomalyThresholdCalibrationLaw` — The anomaly detector's threshold must be calibrated so that the false-positive rate on the baseline period is below `alpha`; uncalibrated detectors must not trigger alerts.
- `AppP.C2.d`: `CorrelationCausalityLaw` — The correlation tracer must distinguish correlation from causation: correlated anomalies are reported as potentially linked, not as confirmed causal chains, unless a dependency edge exists.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `AppP.C3.a`: `DashboardBuilder` — Reads the deployment manifest, discovers all element servers, subscribes to their telemetry streams, and constructs a per-element panel with standard metric visualizations.
- `AppP.C3.b`: `ResonanceVectorComputer` — Polls each element server's health and load metrics, normalizes them to `[0, 1]`, assembles the 8D vector, and publishes it to the telemetry dashboard at configurable intervals.
- `AppP.C3.c`: `BaselineProfiler` — Collects metric values over a configurable baseline window, fits a Gaussian or non-parametric distribution to each metric, and stores the baseline parameters for the anomaly detector.
- `AppP.C3.d`: `IncidentCorrelator` — When the anomaly detector fires, queries all other element servers' metrics in the same time window, runs pairwise correlation tests, and groups co-occurring anomalies into incident clusters.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `AppP.C4.a`: `TelemetryCoverageCert` — Proves that all deployed element servers are emitting telemetry by exhibiting the set of servers in the deployment manifest and the set of servers with active telemetry subscriptions, showing equality.
- `AppP.C4.b`: `ResonanceVectorValidityCert` — Proves that the resonance vector is correctly computed by exhibiting the raw metrics, the normalization function, and the resulting vector components, verifiable by recomputation.
- `AppP.C4.c`: `AnomalyCalibrationCert` — Proves that the anomaly detector is correctly calibrated by exhibiting the baseline period metrics, the fitted distribution parameters, and the achieved false-positive rate.
- `AppP.C4.d`: `IncidentClusterCert` — Proves that an incident cluster is valid by exhibiting the anomalies in the cluster, their timestamps, and the pairwise correlation coefficients exceeding the linkage threshold.

### Lens R

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `AppP.R1.a`: `SelfConfiguringServer` — A server that reads its own SFCR element assignment from the deployment manifest, auto-generates its server profile, configures its resource limits, and begins serving without manual setup.
- `AppP.R1.b`: `AutoScalingPolicy` — A policy object embedded in the deployment manifest that specifies scaling rules: metric thresholds for scale-up/scale-down, cooldown periods, and minimum/maximum instance counts per element.
- `AppP.R1.c`: `SelfHealingWatchdog` — A local agent on each server that detects degraded states (memory leaks, stuck threads, shard corruption), attempts automated remediation, and escalates to failover only if self-healing fails.
- `AppP.R1.d`: `DeploymentGenome` — A compact, self-describing specification from which an entire deployment can be bootstrapped: it encodes all server profiles, scaling policies, health checks, and monitoring configurations in a single artifact.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `AppP.R2.a`: `SelfConfigurationIdempotencyLaw` — A self-configuring server must produce identical configuration regardless of how many times it re-reads the manifest; configuration is a pure function of the manifest content.
- `AppP.R2.b`: `ScalingBoundednessLaw` — Auto-scaling must respect the minimum and maximum instance counts defined in the policy; no scaling action may produce an instance count outside these bounds.
- `AppP.R2.c`: `SelfHealingEscalationLaw` — Self-healing must attempt local remediation before escalating; direct escalation without attempted self-healing is a violation unless the degradation is classified as non-remediable.
- `AppP.R2.d`: `GenomeBootstrapDeterminismLaw` — Bootstrapping a deployment from the same genome on the same infrastructure must produce identical deployments; the genome is a deterministic specification, not a stochastic process.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `AppP.R3.a`: `BootstrapSequencer` — Takes a deployment genome, parses it, generates server profiles for each element, provisions infrastructure, deploys servers in dependency order, and runs post-deployment health checks.
- `AppP.R3.b`: `AutoScaler` — Monitors the resonance vector and per-element load metrics, evaluates scaling rules from the auto-scaling policy, and issues scale-up or scale-down commands with cooldown enforcement.
- `AppP.R3.c`: `RemediationEngine` — Maintains a library of remediation procedures (restart, cache flush, shard reindex, thread pool reset) and selects the appropriate one based on the detected degradation pattern.
- `AppP.R3.d`: `GenomeEvolver` — Compares the current deployment state against the genome, identifies drift (manual changes, unplanned scaling), and either reconciles the deployment to match the genome or updates the genome to reflect intentional changes.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `AppP.R4.a`: `SelfConfigurationCert` — Proves that a self-configuring server's generated configuration matches what the manifest specifies by exhibiting both and showing field-by-field equality.
- `AppP.R4.b`: `ScalingComplianceCert` — Proves that all scaling actions respected the policy bounds by exhibiting the scaling event log with before/after instance counts and the policy's min/max values.
- `AppP.R4.c`: `SelfHealingAuditCert` — Proves that self-healing was attempted before escalation by exhibiting the remediation log with timestamps, actions taken, and outcomes, showing local remediation preceded any failover.
- `AppP.R4.d`: `GenomeFidelityCert` — Proves that the current deployment matches the genome by exhibiting a diff between the genome's declared state and the deployment's observed state, showing zero unintended divergences.
