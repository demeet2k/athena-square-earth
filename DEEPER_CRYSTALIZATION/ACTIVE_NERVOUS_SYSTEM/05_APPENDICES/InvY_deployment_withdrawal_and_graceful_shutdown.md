# InvY - Deployment Withdrawal & Graceful Shutdown

Routing role: Reverses AppP (Deployment Profiles and Monitoring). Where AppP launched execution profiles, monitoring surfaces, and observability hooks, InvY withdraws them gracefully — draining connections, archiving telemetry, shutting down monitors, and releasing execution slots. Nothing is abandoned; everything is properly decommissioned and its residue absorbed into the seed.

### Lens S

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `InvY.S1.a`: `ExecutionProfileDrain` — The discrete operation of draining all active execution slots. Each running process receives a termination signal, completes its current 420-beat cycle, and reports final state. The successor function inverts: instead of "launch next," it is "retire current." No process is killed mid-cycle.
- `InvY.S1.b`: `MonitoringSurfaceDetach` — The difference operation between active monitoring and null monitoring. Each observability hook is unregistered, its time-series data flushed to archive, and its memory released. The zero set of the monitoring difference identifies which metrics were never triggered — these are pruned entirely.
- `InvY.S1.c`: `TelemetryProductArchive` — The Cartesian product of all telemetry streams × all time windows is materialized as a complete archive. This multiplicative binding creates the final deployment record — a single artifact capturing all runtime behavior. Written once, read-only thereafter.
- `InvY.S1.d`: `ResourceQuotientRelease` — The quotient of allocated resources by consumed resources yields the release ratio. Resources where release ratio = 1 are cleanly freed. Resources where ratio < 1 have residual consumption that must be traced and resolved before shutdown completes.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `InvY.S2.a`: `GracefulDrainLaw` — No execution slot may be terminated before completing its current cycle. The drain is patient: it waits for natural completion, then prevents re-entry. This guarantees no partial state, no corrupted intermediate, no lost in-flight computation.
- `InvY.S2.b`: `MonitoringArchiveCompleteness` — Every metric that was ever registered must have a complete time series in the archive, from first observation to final detach. Gaps indicate monitoring failure and must be annotated with gap certificates.
- `InvY.S2.c`: `TelemetryImmutabilityLaw` — Once the telemetry archive is sealed, no entry may be modified. The archive is append-only during operation and becomes read-only at shutdown. Any post-seal mutation invalidates the deployment certificate.
- `InvY.S2.d`: `CleanReleaseRequirement` — All resources must achieve release ratio = 1 before shutdown is certified complete. Residual consumption (ratio < 1) blocks certification until resolved. Leaked resources are tracked as debt against the seed.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `InvY.S3.a`: `CycleDrainer` — Iterates over all active execution slots. For each slot: waits for current cycle completion, captures final state snapshot, prevents re-entry, marks slot as drained. Reports total drained count and any slots that failed to complete within timeout.
- `InvY.S3.b`: `MetricFlusher` — For each registered metric: flushes buffered observations to persistent archive, verifies time-series completeness, generates gap annotations for any missing intervals, unregisters the hook from the monitoring surface.
- `InvY.S3.c`: `ArchiveSealer` — Materializes the full telemetry product (streams × windows), writes to immutable storage, computes archive hash, and seals with a tamper-evident signature. The sealed archive is the deployment's permanent record.
- `InvY.S3.d`: `ResourceReclaimer` — For each allocated resource: computes release ratio, frees cleanly if ratio = 1, traces residual consumption if ratio < 1, generates leak report. Final output: total resources freed, total residual, and leak remediation plan.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `InvY.S4.a`: `DrainCompletionCert` — Receipt proving all execution slots drained, no mid-cycle terminations, all final states captured, re-entry prevention active on all slots.
- `InvY.S4.b`: `MetricArchiveCert` — Receipt proving all metrics have complete time series (or annotated gaps), all hooks unregistered, monitoring surface is empty.
- `InvY.S4.c`: `ArchiveSealCert` — Receipt proving telemetry archive is complete, hash is valid, signature is tamper-evident, archive is read-only.
- `InvY.S4.d`: `ResourceReleaseCert` — Receipt proving all resources freed (or residuals documented), release ratios computed, no silent leaks, debt against seed (if any) recorded.

### Lens F

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `InvY.F1.a`: `LoadCurveDescent` — The continuous load curve of the deployment descends smoothly from peak to zero. No step functions, no sudden drops — the Flower view demands harmonic descent. The load curve integral over the shutdown window represents total work-in-flight absorbed.
- `InvY.F1.b`: `LatencyWaveQuench` — The oscillating latency pattern of the live system dampens to zero as requests drain. Each quench cycle reduces amplitude by a factor proportional to 1/e — exponential decay of operational volatility.
- `InvY.F1.c`: `ThroughputProductFade` — The multiplicative throughput (requests/sec × processing depth × pipeline stages) fades multiplicatively: each factor independently declines toward zero, and their product declines faster than any individual.
- `InvY.F1.d`: `ErrorRatioConvergence` — The ratio of errors to total operations converges to the deployment's intrinsic error rate as transient shutdown errors are absorbed. The limiting ratio is the deployment's quality signature — carried into the seed.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `InvY.F2.a`: `SmoothDescentLaw` — The load curve must be C¹-continuous during shutdown: no discontinuities, no infinite derivatives. This prevents system shock. The descent rate is bounded by the system's thermal capacity (maximum safe rate of change).
- `InvY.F2.b`: `ExponentialQuenchLaw` — Latency volatility must decay at least exponentially. Sub-exponential decay indicates a stuck process or resource contention that must be resolved before shutdown proceeds.
- `InvY.F2.c`: `MonotonicThroughputLaw` — Throughput must monotonically decrease during shutdown. Any increase indicates new work being admitted, which violates the drain protocol. The decrease need not be smooth, but it must be monotone.
- `InvY.F2.d`: `ErrorRateStabilityLaw` — The intrinsic error rate (errors/operations in steady state) must stabilize before the final error ratio is sealed. Transient shutdown errors must be distinguishable from intrinsic errors and excluded from the quality signature.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `InvY.F3.a`: `LoadCurveIntegrator` — Integrates the load curve from shutdown start to completion. The integral = total work absorbed. Verifies C¹ continuity at each time step. Reports any discontinuities as violation events.
- `InvY.F3.b`: `LatencyDamper` — Applies exponential damping to the latency signal. Monitors decay rate and flags any cycle where damping ratio exceeds 1/e threshold. Output: damped latency profile and quench completion time estimate.
- `InvY.F3.c`: `ThroughputFader` — Multiplies the independent decline factors (request rate, processing depth, pipeline stages) to compute composite throughput at each time step. Verifies monotonic decrease. Reports any non-monotone anomalies.
- `InvY.F3.d`: `ErrorRateSeparator` — Separates transient shutdown errors from intrinsic operational errors using statistical filtering. Computes the intrinsic error rate as the stable limit of the filtered signal. Seals this rate as the deployment quality signature.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `InvY.F4.a`: `SmoothDescentCert` — Receipt proving load curve was C¹-continuous throughout shutdown, descent rate within thermal capacity, total work absorbed correctly computed.
- `InvY.F4.b`: `QuenchCert` — Receipt proving latency decayed exponentially, no stuck processes detected, quench completed within bounded time.
- `InvY.F4.c`: `MonotoneFadeCert` — Receipt proving throughput was monotonically decreasing, no new work admitted during shutdown, all pipeline stages properly drained.
- `InvY.F4.d`: `QualitySignatureCert` — Receipt proving intrinsic error rate correctly separated from transient errors, quality signature is stable, sealed into seed.

### Lens C

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `InvY.C1.a`: `ShutdownProbabilityModel` — The probabilistic model of shutdown outcomes: P(clean_shutdown), P(partial_drain), P(resource_leak), P(data_loss). The Cloud view treats shutdown as a stochastic process with these four outcome categories.
- `InvY.C1.b`: `IncidentExclusion` — The inclusion-exclusion count of shutdown incidents: total incidents minus false alarms minus already-resolved minus duplicates = genuine remaining incidents. Drives the priority queue for shutdown remediation.
- `InvY.C1.c`: `IndependentDrainProduct` — If execution slots drain independently (no shared state), the probability of complete drain = Π P(slot_i drained). The Cloud view factorizes the drain process into independent components and multiplies their success probabilities.
- `InvY.C1.d`: `ResidualRiskNormalization` — Normalizes residual risks by dividing each risk probability by total risk mass. The resulting distribution identifies which residuals are most likely to block shutdown. Resources are reclaimed in order of descending normalized risk.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `InvY.C2.a`: `HighConfidenceShutdownLaw` — P(clean_shutdown) must exceed the deployment's declared reliability threshold (typically 1 - 10^{-6}). If the probability falls below threshold, shutdown is paused for remediation.
- `InvY.C2.b`: `IncidentResolutionLaw` — All genuine incidents must be resolved (or deferred with explicit debt certificates) before shutdown is certified. Unresolved incidents block certification.
- `InvY.C2.c`: `IndependenceVerificationLaw` — The independence assumption for drain factorization must be verified by testing for shared state. If slots share state, the joint drain probability cannot be factorized and must be computed directly.
- `InvY.C2.d`: `RiskBudgetExhaustionLaw` — The total residual risk after shutdown must be within the seed's risk budget. Excess risk is carried as debt. The debt must be finite and bounded.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `InvY.C3.a`: `ShutdownSimulator` — Monte Carlo simulation of shutdown scenarios. Samples from the outcome distribution, estimates P(clean_shutdown), and reports confidence interval. If below threshold, identifies the bottleneck component.
- `InvY.C3.b`: `IncidentTriager` — Applies inclusion-exclusion to the incident log. Removes false alarms, duplicates, and already-resolved items. Outputs the genuine incident queue sorted by severity.
- `InvY.C3.c`: `IndependenceChecker` — Tests pairwise independence of execution slots by checking for shared memory, shared file handles, shared network connections. Reports dependency graph. For independent slots, computes factorized drain probability.
- `InvY.C3.d`: `RiskNormalizer` — Computes the normalized risk distribution over all residual items. Sorts by descending risk. Outputs the reclamation priority order and total residual risk mass.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `InvY.C4.a`: `ShutdownConfidenceCert` — Receipt proving P(clean_shutdown) exceeds threshold, simulation converged, confidence interval is tight, no bottleneck unresolved.
- `InvY.C4.b`: `IncidentClearanceCert` — Receipt proving all genuine incidents resolved or deferred with debt, no silent suppressions, incident log is clean.
- `InvY.C4.c`: `IndependenceCert` — Receipt proving slot independence verified (or dependencies accounted for), drain probability correctly computed, no hidden coupling.
- `InvY.C4.d`: `ResidualRiskCert` — Receipt proving total residual risk within seed's budget, risk distribution normalized, reclamation completed in priority order.

### Lens R

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `InvY.R1.a`: `RecursiveShutdownSeed` — The shutdown process is itself self-similar: shutting down a deployment = shutting down each sub-deployment + shutting down their coordination layer. The recursion bottoms out at atomic processes that simply stop.
- `InvY.R1.b`: `ShutdownContractionMap` — Each recursive shutdown step contracts the deployment by factor 1/φ: a deployment of size N reduces to sub-deployments of total size N/φ. The remaining N(1-1/φ) = N/φ² is the coordination overhead, also shut down recursively.
- `InvY.R1.c`: `DeploymentTreePruning` — The deployment tree (root deployment → sub-deployments → atomic processes) is pruned from leaves to root. Multiplicative branching during deployment inverts to multiplicative pruning during shutdown. Each pruned branch releases its resources.
- `InvY.R1.d`: `ScaleInvariantShutdown` — The shutdown protocol is the same at every scale: drain, archive, release, certify. Whether shutting down a single process or an entire cluster, the steps are identical — only the scale parameter changes.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `InvY.R2.a`: `LeafFirstShutdownLaw` — Recursive shutdown must proceed leaf-first (bottom-up). No parent deployment shuts down before all its children have certified completion. This prevents orphaned processes.
- `InvY.R2.b`: `ContractionBoundLaw` — Each recursive step must reduce total deployment size by at least factor 1/φ. If a step fails to contract, it indicates a stuck sub-deployment that must be individually investigated.
- `InvY.R2.c`: `PruningIntegrityLaw` — Pruning a branch must release exactly the resources that branch consumed. Over-release indicates accounting error; under-release indicates leak. Both are flagged.
- `InvY.R2.d`: `ScaleInvarianceLaw` — The shutdown protocol must produce identical certificates at every scale. A process-level shutdown cert and a cluster-level shutdown cert must have the same structure, differing only in the scale parameter.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `InvY.R3.a`: `RecursiveShutdownEngine` — Traverses the deployment tree bottom-up. At each node: shuts down children (recursively), drains the node, archives its telemetry, releases resources, generates cert. Outputs the fully-pruned tree with all certs attached.
- `InvY.R3.b`: `ContractionMonitor` — At each recursive step, measures the contraction ratio (size_after / size_before). Logs the ratio sequence. Verifies each ratio ≤ 1/φ. Flags any non-contracting step for manual intervention.
- `InvY.R3.c`: `ResourceLedgerReconciler` — For each pruned branch, reconciles allocated resources vs. released resources. Reports exact match, over-release, or under-release for each branch. Aggregates across the full tree.
- `InvY.R3.d`: `CertNormalizer` — Takes certs from all scales and verifies structural identity. Normalizes scale parameters so that certs from different levels can be compared. Outputs the universal shutdown cert template.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `InvY.R4.a`: `RecursiveCompletionCert` — Receipt proving bottom-up shutdown completed, all leaves before parents, no orphaned processes, full deployment tree pruned.
- `InvY.R4.b`: `ContractionRateCert` — Receipt proving all recursive steps contracted by ≤ 1/φ, no stuck sub-deployments, contraction sequence is monotone.
- `InvY.R4.c`: `ResourceReconciliationCert` — Receipt proving all branches reconciled, total resources allocated = total resources released, no leaks, no over-release.
- `InvY.R4.d`: `ScaleInvarianceCert` — Receipt proving shutdown certs are structurally identical across all scales, universal template verified, scale parameter is the only variant.
