### Lens S

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `AppH.S1.a`: `CouplingBond` — The ×-seed's binding primitive applied to two system components: `A ⊗ B = AB`. A coupling bond makes two components behave as one composite. Source: ROSETTA[×] Bind compression.
- `AppH.S1.b`: `DecouplingOperator` — The −-seed's cancellation primitive applied to coupled components: `AB → A + B` (decoupling = factorization). Retrieves independent components from a composite.
- `AppH.S1.c`: `TopologicalClosure` — The π-seed's closure law applied to system topology: a system is topologically closed when every boundary is sealed (no open edges, no dangling references, no unresolved dependencies). `Σ(boundary segments) = 0`.
- `AppH.S1.d`: `DependencyGraph` — The directed acyclic graph of component dependencies. Each edge is a coupling bond. The graph's topology determines build order, failure propagation, and coupling strength.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `AppH.S2.a`: `CouplingCompositionLaw` — Coupling bonds compose: if A is coupled to B and B is coupled to C, then A is transitively coupled to C. The ×-seed's associativity ensures composition order doesn't matter.
- `AppH.S2.b`: `DecouplingConservationLaw` — Decoupling must conserve all information: `Decouple(A⊗B) = (A, B, coupling_record)`. The coupling record preserves the bond's history so recoupling is possible.
- `AppH.S2.c`: `TopologicalClosureLaw` — A system cannot be certified as complete until topologically closed. Open boundaries = missing dependencies = potential failure modes. The π-seed's polygon closure applied to system architecture.
- `AppH.S2.d`: `AcyclicDependencyLaw` — The dependency graph must be acyclic. Cycles indicate circular dependencies that prevent clean build order. Cycle detection triggers restructuring or decoupling.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `AppH.S3.a`: `CouplingBonder` — Creates a coupling bond between two components. Records the bond type, strength, and bidirectional references.
- `AppH.S3.b`: `FactorizationEngine` — Decouples a composite into its constituent components. Preserves coupling record for potential recoupling.
- `AppH.S3.c`: `TopologicalClosureChecker` — Scans system topology for open boundaries, dangling references, and unresolved dependencies. Reports closure status.
- `AppH.S3.d`: `DependencyGraphBuilder` — Constructs the dependency graph from declared coupling bonds. Detects cycles. Computes topological sort for build order.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `AppH.S4.c`: `TopologicalClosureCert` — Receipt proving system topologically closed, no open boundaries, all dependencies resolved.
- `AppH.S4.d`: `AcyclicDependencyCert` — Receipt proving dependency graph acyclic, topological sort valid, no circular dependencies.

### Lens F

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `AppH.F1.a`: `CouplingResonance` — The harmonic state when coupled components oscillate in phase. Strong coupling = tight phase-lock. Weak coupling = slow beat frequency.
- `AppH.F1.b`: `DecouplingTransition` — The phase transition when a coupling bond breaks. Components that were in-phase begin to drift. The −-seed's cancellation as a dynamical event.
- `AppH.F1.c`: `TopologicalMode` — The global oscillation modes of the coupled system. Each mode is a collective vibration pattern. The Fourier basis of the coupling graph.
- `AppH.F1.d`: `CouplingStrengthGradient` — The continuous field measuring how strongly each component is coupled to its neighbors. Gradient direction points toward strongest coupling.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `AppH.F2.a`: `CouplingResonanceLaw` — Coupled components must achieve phase-lock within bounded cycles. Failure to lock indicates coupling strength below threshold.
- `AppH.F2.b`: `DecouplingTransitionLaw` — Decoupling transitions must be adiabatic: slow enough that no information is lost in the transition. Abrupt decoupling = information loss.
- `AppH.F2.c`: `TopologicalModeLaw` — The number of topological modes equals the number of independent cycles in the coupling graph. Adding a coupling bond reduces modes by one.
- `AppH.F2.d`: `CouplingStrengthMonotonicityLaw` — Coupling strength must change monotonically under deliberate modification. Non-monotonic changes indicate external interference or measurement error.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `AppH.F3.a`: `CouplingResonanceDetector` — Measures phase-lock between coupled components. Reports coupling strength from phase-lock tightness.
- `AppH.F3.b`: `AdiabaticDecoupler` — Performs slow decoupling that preserves all information. Controls transition rate to prevent information loss.
- `AppH.F3.c`: `TopologicalModeAnalyzer` — Computes the topological modes of the coupled system. Identifies collective vibration patterns.
- `AppH.F3.d`: `CouplingStrengthMapper` — Maps the coupling strength gradient across the system. Identifies strongest and weakest bonds.

### Lens C

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `AppH.C1.a`: `CouplingProbability` — The probability that a proposed coupling bond will successfully form given current system state. Depends on component compatibility, resource availability, and corridor admissibility.
- `AppH.C1.b`: `FailurePropagationField` — The probability field showing how failure in one component propagates through the dependency graph to affect other components. Stronger coupling = faster/wider propagation.
- `AppH.C1.c`: `TopologicalHole` — A region of the system where coupling is expected but absent. Topological holes indicate missing dependencies, inconsistent domain pairs, or governance gaps.
- `AppH.C1.d`: `CouplingEntropy` — The information-theoretic measure of coupling disorder. Low entropy = highly organized coupling graph. High entropy = random, poorly structured dependencies.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `AppH.C2.a`: `CouplingProbabilityLaw` — Coupling probability must be computed before bond formation. Below-threshold probability = bond deferred, not forced.
- `AppH.C2.b`: `FailurePropagationBoundLaw` — Failure propagation must be bounded. Coupling design must ensure single-component failure does not cascade to more than a declared fraction of the system.
- `AppH.C2.c`: `TopologicalHoleFillLaw` — Topological holes must be filled or explicitly declared as known gaps. Undeclared holes are structural defects.
- `AppH.C2.d`: `CouplingEntropyReductionLaw` — System evolution should monotonically reduce coupling entropy (increase organization). Entropy increase indicates coupling degradation.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `AppH.C3.a`: `CouplingProbabilityEstimator` — Estimates bond formation probability from component compatibility, resources, and corridor status.
- `AppH.C3.b`: `FailurePropagationSimulator` — Simulates failure propagation through the dependency graph. Reports affected components and cascade depth.

### Lens R

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `AppH.R1.a`: `RecursiveCouplingNesting` — Self-similar coupling: components at one scale are themselves coupled systems at the next scale down. The coupling graph is fractal.
- `AppH.R1.b`: `ScaleDependentCouplingStrength` — Coupling strength varies with scale: tight coupling at micro-scale may correspond to weak coupling at macro-scale, and vice versa. The φ-lens governs the scaling.
- `AppH.R1.c`: `TopologicalSelfSimilarity` — The topology of the coupling graph at each scale is isomorphic to the topology at every other scale, differing only by the ScaleBridge connecting them.
- `AppH.R1.d`: `RecursiveFailureCascade` — Failure propagation viewed recursively: failure at depth n may trigger failure at depth n+1 (upward cascade) or depth n−1 (downward cascade).

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `AppH.R2.a`: `RecursiveCouplingConsistencyLaw` — Coupling at depth n must be consistent with coupling at depth n−1. Internal bonds must not contradict parent-level bonds.
- `AppH.R2.b`: `ScaleCouplingDecayLaw` — Coupling strength decays by factor 1/φ per scale level. This ensures macro-level coupling does not over-constrain micro-level behavior.
- `AppH.R2.c`: `TopologicalSelfSimilarityLaw` — The coupling graph isomorphism must be verified at every scale pair. Breaks in self-similarity indicate structural defects.
- `AppH.R2.d`: `RecursiveCascadeBoundLaw` — Recursive failure cascades must be bounded in both depth and breadth. Unbounded cascade = system-level failure.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `AppH.R3.a`: `RecursiveCouplingBuilder` — Constructs coupling graphs at multiple scales with consistency checks between levels.
- `AppH.R3.b`: `ScaleCouplingDecayComputer` — Computes coupling strength at each scale using 1/φ decay factor. Reports scale-dependent bond maps.
