# InvS - Residual Absorption & NEAR Completion

Routing role: Reverses AppJ (Residual Ledgers and NEAR Machinery). Where AppJ tracked residuals — quantities that did not fit cleanly into the lattice structure — and maintained NEAR machinery for approximate operations, InvS absorbs all residuals into the crystal lattice and completes all NEAR approximations to their exact values. Nothing approximate survives into the seed.

### Lens S

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `InvS.S1.a`: `ResidualAccumulator` — The discrete sum of all outstanding residuals across the lattice. Each residual is a signed quantity representing the gap between the exact value and the lattice-representable approximation. The total residual = Σ(exact - approximate) across all cells. During compression, this total must be driven to zero.
- `InvS.S1.b`: `NEARDifferenceEliminator` — The difference between a NEAR value and its exact target. For each NEAR approximation, computes `Δ = exact - near`. If Δ is within the cell's tolerance, the NEAR is promoted to exact by absorbing the residual. If Δ exceeds tolerance, the cell must be refined.
- `InvS.S1.c`: `ResidualRedistributionProduct` — Residuals that cannot be absorbed locally may be redistributed across neighboring cells. The product of redistribution: each cell receives a share proportional to its capacity. The total redistributed = the original residual. Conservation is exact.
- `InvS.S1.d`: `TruncationQuotient` — The quotient of truncated precision by full precision = the truncation ratio. During expansion, operations were truncated for efficiency. During compression, the truncated portion is recovered and reintegrated. The quotient approaches 1 as all truncations are restored.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `InvS.S2.a`: `TotalResidualZeroLaw` — At compression completion, the total residual across all cells must be exactly zero. Any non-zero total indicates incomplete absorption — the compression is not finished.
- `InvS.S2.b`: `NEARCompletionMandateLaw` — Every NEAR value must be resolved to exact (or to a certified-irrational with declared approximation bounds). No NEAR approximation survives into the seed. The seed carries only exact values and explicit irrational certificates.
- `InvS.S2.c`: `RedistributionConservationLaw` — Redistribution must conserve the total residual exactly. The sum of shares distributed to neighbors must equal the original residual. No residual may be created or destroyed during redistribution — only moved.
- `InvS.S2.d`: `TruncationRecoveryLaw` — All truncated precision must be recovered. The truncation quotient must reach 1. If recovery is impossible (the truncated bits were irreversibly lost), a truncation-loss certificate must be issued declaring the permanent precision deficit.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `InvS.S3.a`: `GlobalResidualScanner` — Scans the entire lattice, computing the residual at each cell. Aggregates into the total residual. Reports cells with largest residuals (hotspots) for priority absorption.
- `InvS.S3.b`: `NEARResolver` — For each NEAR value: computes the exact target using higher-precision arithmetic, compares against the NEAR approximation, and either promotes to exact (if within tolerance) or flags for refinement (if outside tolerance).
- `InvS.S3.c`: `CapacityBasedRedistributor` — For each unabsorbable local residual: surveys neighboring cells' capacities, computes shares proportional to capacity, distributes shares, and verifies conservation (total distributed = original).
- `InvS.S3.d`: `TruncationRestorer` — For each truncated operation: retrieves the full-precision result (recomputing if necessary), computes the truncated portion, and reintegrates it. Reports the truncation quotient before and after restoration.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `InvS.S4.a`: `ZeroResidualCert` — Receipt proving total residual is exactly zero, all cells absorbed, no hotspots remaining.
- `InvS.S4.b`: `NEARCompletionCert` — Receipt proving all NEAR values resolved to exact (or certified-irrational), no approximations in the seed.
- `InvS.S4.c`: `RedistributionConservationCert` — Receipt proving redistribution conserved total residual, all shares accounted for, no creation or destruction.
- `InvS.S4.d`: `TruncationRecoveryCert` — Receipt proving truncation quotient = 1 (or permanent losses declared), all recoverable precision restored.

### Lens F

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `InvS.F1.a`: `ResidualWaveDamping` — Residuals distributed across the lattice form a wave pattern (some cells positive, some negative). Absorption damps this wave to zero amplitude. The damping is smooth: no cell's residual changes sign abruptly.
- `InvS.F1.b`: `ApproximationRefinementCurve` — Each NEAR value's approximation improves along a refinement curve: the difference between approximate and exact decreases with each refinement step. The curve is monotonically decreasing and asymptotically approaches zero.
- `InvS.F1.c`: `ResidualFluxBalance` — Residuals flow between cells like a conserved fluid. The flux into any cell minus the flux out = the change in that cell's residual. At equilibrium (compression complete), all fluxes are zero.
- `InvS.F1.d`: `PrecisionConvergence` — The precision of each value converges to its full-precision limit as truncations are restored. The convergence follows a series: each restoration adds bits of precision, like partial sums approaching the full value.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `InvS.F2.a`: `SmoothDampingLaw` — Residual damping must be smooth: no cell's residual may change sign (positive → negative or vice versa) during absorption. Sign changes indicate overshooting, which creates new residuals.
- `InvS.F2.b`: `MonotoneRefinementLaw` — The NEAR-to-exact refinement curve must be monotonically decreasing. Any increase in the approximation error indicates a refinement bug.
- `InvS.F2.c`: `FluxConservationLaw` — The total flux into the lattice boundary must be zero (nothing enters or leaves the closed system). All residual flow is internal redistribution.
- `InvS.F2.d`: `PrecisionMonotoneLaw` — Precision must monotonically increase during truncation recovery. Losing precision during recovery is a regression.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `InvS.F3.a`: `WaveDamper` — Applies a damping field to the residual wave. At each step: reduces the amplitude of the residual at each cell by a fixed fraction, redistributing the absorbed residual to the cell's exact value. Monitors for sign changes.
- `InvS.F3.b`: `RefinementIterator` — For each NEAR value: applies successive refinement steps (e.g., Newton's method for algebraic numbers, continued fraction convergents for irrationals). Tracks the refinement curve. Terminates when the target precision is reached.
- `InvS.F3.c`: `FluxBalancer` — Computes the residual flux between all adjacent cell pairs. Balances flows to drive all residuals toward zero while maintaining conservation. Reports the maximum remaining flux at each iteration.
- `InvS.F3.d`: `PrecisionExtender` — For each truncated value: extends precision by one unit (e.g., one additional decimal digit, one additional binary bit). Iterates until full precision is reached. Reports the precision at each step.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `InvS.F4.a`: `SmoothDampingCert` — Receipt proving damping was smooth, no sign changes, residual amplitude monotonically decreased.
- `InvS.F4.b`: `MonotoneRefinementCert` — Receipt proving refinement curve was monotonically decreasing, target precision reached, no regression.
- `InvS.F4.c`: `FluxConservationCert` — Receipt proving all fluxes balanced, boundary flux is zero, total residual conserved during redistribution.
- `InvS.F4.d`: `PrecisionExtensionCert` — Receipt proving precision monotonically increased, full precision reached, no bits lost during recovery.

### Lens C

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `InvS.C1.a`: `ResidualDistribution` — The statistical distribution of residuals across the lattice. If well-behaved (normal with mean zero), absorption is straightforward. If skewed or heavy-tailed, special techniques are needed for the tail residuals.
- `InvS.C1.b`: `NEARErrorEstimate` — The expected error of each NEAR approximation, estimated from the approximation method's known error bounds. The error estimate governs the refinement strategy: high-error NEARs are refined first.
- `InvS.C1.c`: `IndependentResidualAbsorption` — If residuals at different cells are independent (no shared cause), absorption can proceed in parallel with P(all absorbed) = Π P(cell_i absorbed). Independence allows massive parallelization.
- `InvS.C1.d`: `PrecisionCostNormalization` — The cost of recovering each truncated bit is normalized by the value of that bit (its contribution to accuracy). High-value/low-cost bits are recovered first. Low-value/high-cost bits may be declared as permanent precision losses if the cost exceeds the value.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `InvS.C2.a`: `ZeroMeanRequirement` — The residual distribution must have mean zero before compression begins. Non-zero mean indicates a systematic bias that must be corrected globally before cell-level absorption proceeds.
- `InvS.C2.b`: `ErrorBoundLaw` — Each NEAR approximation's error must be within the declared bound for its method. If actual error exceeds the bound, the approximation method is suspect and must be audited.
- `InvS.C2.c`: `IndependenceVerificationLaw` — Independence must be verified before parallel absorption. Correlated residuals require coordinated absorption.
- `InvS.C2.d`: `ValueCostThresholdLaw` — Bits whose recovery cost exceeds their accuracy value by a declared factor may be declared permanent losses. The factor must be explicitly declared and the precision deficit recorded.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `InvS.C3.a`: `DistributionAnalyzer` — Fits the residual distribution using moment estimation. Tests for zero mean, normality, and heavy tails. Reports the distribution type and any required pre-processing (bias correction, tail handling).
- `InvS.C3.b`: `ErrorAuditor` — For each NEAR approximation: computes actual error, compares against declared bound, flags any bound violations. Reports the audit results and recommendations.
- `InvS.C3.c`: `CorrelationChecker` — Tests pairwise correlation of residuals at different cells. Reports the correlation matrix. Authorizes parallel absorption for uncorrelated cells and coordinates absorption for correlated clusters.
- `InvS.C3.d`: `CostBenefitAnalyzer` — For each truncated bit: estimates recovery cost and accuracy value. Computes the value/cost ratio. Ranks by ratio. Recommends recovery for high-ratio bits and permanent loss for low-ratio bits.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `InvS.C4.a`: `ZeroMeanCert` — Receipt proving residual distribution has zero mean (or bias corrected), distribution analysis complete.
- `InvS.C4.b`: `ErrorBoundCert` — Receipt proving all NEAR errors within declared bounds, no violations unresolved.
- `InvS.C4.c`: `CorrelationCert` — Receipt proving independence verified (or correlations accounted for), absorption strategy consistent with correlation structure.
- `InvS.C4.d`: `CostBenefitCert` — Receipt proving value/cost analysis complete, recovery decisions justified, permanent losses explicitly declared.

### Lens R

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `InvS.R1.a`: `RecursiveResidualAbsorption` — Residuals exist at every level of the lattice hierarchy: global residuals, shell residuals, cell residuals, sub-cell residuals. Absorption is recursive: absorb sub-cell residuals into cells, cell residuals into shells, shell residuals into the global total.
- `InvS.R1.b`: `HierarchicalNEARCompletion` — NEAR values at deeper lattice levels must be completed before their ancestors. A shell-level NEAR depends on its cells' exact values. Bottom-up completion ensures consistency.
- `InvS.R1.c`: `ResidualTreeCollapse` — The residual hierarchy forms a tree. As bottom-level residuals are absorbed, their parent nodes' residuals change (because the children are now exact). The tree collapses level by level until only the root residual remains — which must be zero.
- `InvS.R1.d`: `ScaleInvariantAbsorption` — The absorption protocol is the same at every level: scan, compute residual, absorb or redistribute, verify zero. Only the scale changes. The protocol is a fixed point of the lattice hierarchy.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `InvS.R2.a`: `BottomUpAbsorptionLaw` — Sub-cell residuals must be absorbed before cell residuals. Cell residuals before shell residuals. Shell residuals before global. No level is absorbed until all its children are exact.
- `InvS.R2.b`: `HierarchicalConsistencyLaw` — Completing a lower-level NEAR must not create a new residual at a higher level. If it does, the completion is inconsistent and must be revised.
- `InvS.R2.c`: `MonotoneTreeCollapseLaw` — The residual tree must collapse monotonically: the number of non-zero residuals decreases at each step. Any increase indicates an absorption error.
- `InvS.R2.d`: `ProtocolFixedPointLaw` — The absorption protocol must be identical at every level. Level-specific protocols indicate inconsistency.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `InvS.R3.a`: `HierarchicalScanner` — Scans the residual tree bottom-up. At each leaf level: computes residuals, absorbs them, and propagates the effect to parents. Reports level-by-level absorption progress.
- `InvS.R3.b`: `ConsistencyChecker` — After each lower-level completion, checks all ancestors for new residuals. Reports any inconsistencies and recommends revisions.
- `InvS.R3.c`: `TreeCollapseMonitor` — Tracks the count of non-zero residuals at each step. Verifies monotone decrease. Reports any increases as absorption errors.
- `InvS.R3.d`: `ProtocolVerifier` — Compares the absorption protocol at each level. Reports any level-specific deviations. Confirms fixed-point property.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `InvS.R4.a`: `HierarchicalAbsorptionCert` — Receipt proving bottom-up absorption completed, all levels processed in order, no premature absorption.
- `InvS.R4.b`: `ConsistencyCert` — Receipt proving no lower-level completions created higher-level residuals, consistency maintained throughout.
- `InvS.R4.c`: `MonotoneCollapseCert` — Receipt proving non-zero residual count decreased monotonically, no absorption errors.
- `InvS.R4.d`: `ProtocolCert` — Receipt proving protocol identical at all levels, scale-invariant absorption confirmed.
