### Lens S

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- S1a: `MemoryCell` — An addressable, typed storage unit that holds a single datum with associated provenance metadata, timestamp, and integrity hash.
- S1b: `PersistenceEngine` — The subsystem responsible for durably writing memory cells to long-term storage and guaranteeing their availability across restart boundaries.
- S1c: `RegenerationSeed` — A compact, self-contained blueprint from which a destroyed or corrupted memory cell can be fully reconstructed to its last certified state.
- S1d: `StorageContract` — A binding agreement between a memory cell and the persistence engine specifying retention duration, redundancy level, and regeneration obligations.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- S2a: `MemoryAddressabilityLaw` — Every memory cell must have a unique, system-wide address; address collisions are structurally forbidden and trigger immediate quarantine.
- S2b: `PersistenceGuarantee` — A memory cell committed to persistent storage must survive any single-point failure; the persistence engine must maintain at least the declared redundancy level.
- S2c: `RegenerationFidelityRule` — A regenerated memory cell must be bit-identical to its last certified state; any deviation constitutes a regeneration failure.
- S2d: `StorageContractEnforcement` — The persistence engine must honor all active storage contracts; failure to meet a contract's terms triggers an escalation to Ch16.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- S3a: `MemoryCellAllocator` — Creates a new memory cell with a unique address, initializes its provenance metadata, and registers it with the persistence engine.
- S3b: `PersistenceWriter` — Durably writes a memory cell's contents to long-term storage, computing and storing the integrity hash for later verification.
- S3c: `RegenerationExecutor` — Takes a regeneration seed and reconstructs the corresponding memory cell, verifying bit-identity against the seed's certified hash.
- S3d: `ContractNegotiator` — Establishes a storage contract between a memory cell and the persistence engine, computing the required redundancy and retention parameters.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- S4a: `MemoryAllocationCertificate` — Proves that a memory cell was allocated with a unique address and properly registered with no collision.
- S4b: `PersistenceWriteReceipt` — Certifies that a memory cell's contents were durably written to storage with a valid integrity hash.
- S4c: `RegenerationFidelitySeal` — Proves that a regenerated memory cell is bit-identical to the original's last certified state.
- S4d: `ContractComplianceProof` — Attests that the persistence engine met all terms of an active storage contract during the audited period.

### Lens F

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- F1a: `EncodingPhaseRegister` — A cyclic state variable tracking the current stage of the memory lifecycle (encoding, storage, retrieval, regeneration).
- F1b: `StoragePhaseOscillator` — A periodic signal governing the rhythm at which memory cells transition between active use and persistent storage.
- F1c: `RetrievalWavefront` — The expanding search surface as a retrieval request propagates through the memory address space seeking the target cell.
- F1d: `PersistenceRhythmEnvelope` — The bounded region of acceptable timing for persistence write operations, ensuring they complete within the declared latency window.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- F2a: `LifecyclePhaseContinuity` — Memory lifecycle phases must transition continuously; skipping a phase (e.g., encoding directly to regeneration) requires an explicit bypass certificate.
- F2b: `StorageOscillationStability` — The storage phase oscillator must maintain stable frequency within declared tolerance; drift triggers recalibration.
- F2c: `RetrievalCausalityBound` — The retrieval wavefront may not return results from storage states that postdate the retrieval request's timestamp.
- F2d: `PersistenceLatencyGuarantee` — Every persistence write must complete within the declared latency window; timeout constitutes a contract violation.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- F3a: `LifecyclePhaseTracker` — Monitors the current lifecycle phase of each memory cell and emits transition events at each phase boundary.
- F3b: `OscillatorCalibrator` — Tunes the storage phase oscillator's frequency to match the current workload's persistence demands.
- F3c: `RetrievalWavefrontExpander` — Extends the retrieval search surface by one address-space hop, adding newly reachable cells to the candidate result set.
- F3d: `LatencyMonitor` — Measures actual persistence write latency against the declared window and triggers escalation on timeout.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- F4a: `LifecycleContinuityReceipt` — Proves that a memory cell's lifecycle transitions were continuous with no unauthorized phase skips.
- F4b: `OscillationStabilitySeal` — Certifies that the storage phase oscillator remained within frequency tolerance during the audited interval.
- F4c: `RetrievalCausalityCertificate` — Proves that all retrieval results respect the causal ordering defined by request timestamps.
- F4d: `LatencyComplianceProof` — Attests that all persistence writes completed within the declared latency window during the audited period.

### Lens C

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- C1a: `MemoryTruthState` — A truth value asserting whether a memory cell's current contents match its last certified integrity hash.
- C1b: `RetrievalFidelityPredicate` — A decidable boolean returning true if and only if the retrieved datum is bit-identical to the stored original.
- C1c: `RegenerationCompletenessFlag` — A write-once boolean set when a regeneration operation has fully reconstructed the target cell with verified fidelity.
- C1d: `MemoryTruthCorridor` — The constrained region of valid truth assignments for the memory subsystem, ensuring all operations are logically consistent.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- C2a: `MemoryTruthDecidability` — The truth state of any memory cell must be decidable in finite time given the cell's contents and its last certified hash.
- C2b: `RetrievalFidelityGuarantee` — Every retrieval operation must return a datum that satisfies the fidelity predicate; infidelity triggers re-retrieval or regeneration.
- C2c: `RegenerationCompletenessNecessity` — The regeneration completeness flag may only be set after the regenerated cell passes bit-identity verification against the seed's hash.
- C2d: `MemoryCorridorNarrowness` — The memory truth corridor admits exactly one consistent assignment per storage epoch; ambiguity forces quarantine escalation.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- C3a: `MemoryTruthEvaluator` — Computes the integrity hash of a memory cell's current contents and compares it against the certified hash, emitting a truth state.
- C3b: `FidelityChecker` — Performs bit-level comparison between a retrieved datum and the stored original, producing a fidelity certificate or discrepancy trace.
- C3c: `RegenerationVerifier` — Validates a regenerated cell against its seed's certified hash and sets the completeness flag upon successful verification.
- C3d: `CorridorNarrower` — Iteratively eliminates inconsistent truth assignments from the memory corridor until exactly one remains.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- C4a: `MemoryTruthCertificate` — Proves that a memory cell's contents match its last certified integrity hash at the time of evaluation.
- C4b: `RetrievalFidelitySeal` — Certifies that a specific retrieval returned a datum bit-identical to the stored original.
- C4c: `RegenerationCompletenessProof` — Proves that the regeneration operation fully reconstructed the target cell with verified bit-identity.
- C4d: `CorridorUniquenessReceipt` — Proves that the memory truth corridor resolved to exactly one consistent assignment for the audited epoch.

### Lens R

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- R1a: `RecursiveMemorySeed` — A memory cell definition that generates sub-memories at each recursion level, producing a hierarchy of nested storage structures.
- R1b: `FractalPersistenceTree` — A self-similar tree of persistence engines where each node, when expanded, reveals a complete sub-engine with the same durability properties.
- R1c: `SelfRegeneratingCell` — A memory cell that carries its own regeneration seed internally and can reconstruct itself from its local state without external coordination.
- R1d: `MemoryFixedPoint` — A configuration where the memory cell's contents, after a full persistence-retrieval-regeneration cycle, reproduce the original contents identically.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- R2a: `RecursiveMemoryTermination` — Recursive memory seeds must terminate their expansion within a declared depth bound; infinite memory nesting is forbidden.
- R2b: `FractalPersistenceIsomorphism` — Sub-engines revealed by expanding any node must be structurally isomorphic to the parent persistence engine up to a declared scale.
- R2c: `SelfRegenerationSoundness` — A self-regenerating cell's internal reconstruction must produce results identical to those of the global RegenerationExecutor.
- R2d: `MemoryFixedPointStability` — Perturbations to the memory fixed point must decay, restoring the original contents within a bounded number of persistence cycles.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- R3a: `RecursiveMemoryExpander` — Unfolds a recursive memory seed to the declared depth, instantiating sub-memories and wiring parent-child address links.
- R3b: `FractalPersistenceReplicator` — Clones a persistence engine template at each tree level, adjusting redundancy parameters and storage contracts for the current depth.
- R3c: `SelfRegenerationEngine` — Executes the internal regeneration logic of a self-regenerating cell, verifying bit-identity against its embedded seed.
- R3d: `MemoryFixedPointIterator` — Repeatedly cycles a memory cell through persistence, retrieval, and regeneration until fixed-point convergence is detected.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- R4b: `FractalPersistenceIsomorphismSeal` — Certifies that sub-engines maintain structural isomorphism with the parent at all generated levels.
- R4c: `SelfRegenerationSoundnessReceipt` — Attests that a self-regenerating cell's internal reconstruction matched the global executor's output.
- R4d: `MemoryFixedPointConvergenceCertificate` — Proves that the memory fixed-point iterator converged to a stable self-reproducing state within bounds.
