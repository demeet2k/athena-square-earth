### Lens S

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- S1a: `CertificateChain` — An ordered sequence of certificates where each entry's validity depends on the preceding entry, forming a tamper-evident chain of trust from origin to terminal.
- S1b: `CompressionPath` — A directed path through the manuscript lattice along which a full proof is lawfully compressed into a smaller witness without losing verifiability.
- S1c: `ProofObject` — A self-contained bundle of evidence, inference steps, and signatures that demonstrates a specific claim holds under the system's axioms.
- S1d: `LawfulnessWitness` — A minimal data structure that, when presented to any verifier, suffices to confirm that a compression path obeyed all declared rules.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- S2a: `CertificateChainIntegrity` — Every link in a certificate chain must reference its predecessor by cryptographic hash; any broken link invalidates the entire chain downstream.
- S2b: `CompressionLawfulness` — A compression path is lawful if and only if every reduction step it applies is drawn from the declared set of admissible reduction rules.
- S2c: `ProofObligationCompleteness` — Every claim asserted in the system must have a corresponding proof object filed; unproven claims are marked as conjectural and cannot support downstream certificates.
- S2d: `WitnessMinimality` — A lawfulness witness must contain no more data than the minimum required for verification; bloated witnesses are rejected as potential information leaks.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- S3a: `ChainLinker` — Appends a new certificate to an existing chain, computing the hash link and verifying that the new entry satisfies the chain's type constraints.
- S3b: `CompressionReducer` — Applies an admissible reduction rule to a proof object, emitting a shorter proof and a reduction receipt for audit.
- S3c: `ProofAssembler` — Collects evidence fragments, inference steps, and signatures, then assembles them into a complete, self-contained proof object.
- S3d: `WitnessExtractor` — Derives the minimal lawfulness witness from a full compression path by stripping non-essential data while preserving verifiability.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- S4a: `ChainIntegrityCertificate` — Proves that every link in the certificate chain has a valid hash reference to its predecessor with no gaps or tampering.
- S4b: `CompressionLawfulnessReceipt` — Certifies that every reduction step in the compression path was drawn from the admissible rule set.
- S4c: `ProofCompletenesssSeal` — Attests that every claim in the audited scope has a corresponding proof object on file.
- S4d: `WitnessMinimalityProof` — Proves that the lawfulness witness contains exactly the minimum data required for verification, no more.

### Lens F

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- F1a: `CertificateResonanceField` — The harmonic field generated when multiple certificate chains share common intermediate certificates, enabling cross-chain validation shortcuts.
- F1b: `ProofHarmonicSpectrum` — The frequency decomposition of a proof object's complexity, revealing which inference steps contribute most to its verification cost.
- F1c: `CompressionPhaseState` — A cyclic variable tracking the current stage of a compression path (selection, reduction, witness extraction, sealing).
- F1d: `ClosureWaveFunction` — A propagating signal through the certificate lattice indicating which chains have achieved closure and which remain open.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- F2a: `ResonanceFieldConservation` — The total resonance energy across cross-chain shortcuts must be conserved; creating a shortcut in one region must not silently destroy shortcuts elsewhere.
- F2b: `HarmonicComplexityBound` — The harmonic spectrum of any proof object must have bounded bandwidth; proofs with unbounded spectral complexity are rejected as non-compressible.
- F2c: `CompressionPhaseMonotonicity` — The compression phase must advance monotonically through its cycle; regression to a previous stage requires explicit rollback authorization.
- F2d: `ClosureWaveCausalOrder` — The closure wave may not propagate backwards through the certificate lattice; a chain that was closed cannot be reopened by a subsequent wave.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- F3a: `ResonanceShortcutFinder` — Scans the certificate lattice for shared intermediate certificates and creates validated cross-chain shortcuts where resonance conditions are met.
- F3b: `HarmonicAnalyzer` — Decomposes a proof object into its harmonic spectrum, identifying high-cost inference steps for targeted compression.
- F3c: `CompressionPhaseAdvancer` — Steps the compression phase to the next stage after verifying that all preconditions for the transition are satisfied.
- F3d: `ClosureWavePropagator` — Advances the closure wave through the certificate lattice by one step, marking newly closed chains.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- F4a: `ResonanceConservationReceipt` — Proves that resonance energy was conserved when cross-chain shortcuts were created.
- F4b: `HarmonicBoundCertificate` — Certifies that a proof object's harmonic spectrum falls within the declared bandwidth bound.
- F4c: `CompressionPhaseMonotonicityProof` — Attests that the compression phase advanced strictly forward through its cycle without regression.
- F4d: `ClosureCausalOrderSeal` — Proves that the closure wave propagated only forward through the certificate lattice with no backward reopening.

### Lens C

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- C1a: `ProofValidityState` — A truth value asserting whether a given proof object passes all verification checks under the system's axioms.
- C1b: `CompressionTruthPredicate` — A decidable boolean returning true if and only if a compression path preserves the logical content of the original proof.
- C1c: `CertificateAuthenticityFlag` — A write-once boolean that, once set, declares a certificate as authentic and blocks retroactive modification.
- C1d: `ClosureTruthCorridor` — The constrained region of valid truth assignments through which all certificate-closure operations must pass.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- C2a: `ProofValidityDecidability` — The validity of any proof object must be decidable in time polynomial in the proof's size.
- C2b: `CompressionTruthPreservation` — A compression path is truth-preserving if and only if the compressed witness entails the same claim as the original proof.
- C2c: `AuthenticityIrreversibility` — Once the authenticity flag is set on a certificate, no operation in the system may clear or modify it.
- C2d: `ClosureCorridorUniqueness` — The closure truth corridor admits at most one consistent truth assignment per certificate-closure epoch.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- C3a: `ProofVerifier` — Accepts a proof object and evaluates it step-by-step against the system's axioms, emitting a validity certificate or a detailed failure trace.
- C3b: `CompressionTruthChecker` — Compares the logical content of the original proof against the compressed witness, verifying that entailment is preserved.
- C3c: `AuthenticationStamper` — Sets the authenticity flag on a certificate after all validity and integrity checks pass, sealing it against future modification.
- C3d: `ClosureCorridorResolver` — Eliminates inconsistent truth assignments from the closure corridor until exactly one remains.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- C4a: `ProofValidityCertificate` — Certifies that a specific proof object passed all verification checks and is valid under the system's axioms.
- C4b: `CompressionTruthPreservationSeal` — Proves that the compressed witness entails the same claim as the original uncompressed proof.
- C4c: `AuthenticityIntegrityReceipt` — Attests that the authenticity flag on a certificate was set through the proper verification pipeline and has not been tampered with.
- C4d: `ClosureCorridorUniquenessProof` — Proves that the closure truth corridor resolved to exactly one consistent assignment for the audited epoch.

### Lens R

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- R1a: `RecursiveCertificateSeed` — A certificate definition that generates sub-certificate chains at each recursion level, producing a tree of nested proof hierarchies.
- R1b: `FractalProofTree` — A self-similar tree of proof objects where each node, when expanded, reveals a complete sub-proof with the same structural properties as the parent.
- R1c: `SelfCertifyingCompressor` — A compression engine that carries its own verification logic internally and can validate its own output without external auditors.
- R1d: `CertificateFixedPoint` — A configuration where the certificate chain, when fed through the compression-verification cycle, reproduces itself identically.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- R2a: `RecursiveCertificateTermination` — Recursive certificate seeds must terminate their expansion within a declared depth bound; infinite certificate nesting is forbidden.
- R2b: `FractalProofIsomorphism` — Sub-proofs revealed by expanding any node in the fractal proof tree must be structurally isomorphic to the parent proof up to a declared scale.
- R2c: `SelfCertificationSoundness` — A self-certifying compressor's internal verification must be at least as strict as the global verification pipeline; laxer self-checks are rejected.
- R2d: `CertificateFixedPointStability` — Perturbations to the certificate fixed point must decay, restoring the self-reproducing cycle within a bounded number of iterations.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- R3a: `RecursiveCertificateExpander` — Unfolds a recursive certificate seed to the declared depth, instantiating sub-chains and wiring parent-child hash links.
- R3b: `FractalProofReplicator` — Clones a proof template at each tree level, adjusting the claim scope and evidence granularity for the current recursion depth.
- R3c: `SelfVerificationRunner` — Executes the internal verification logic of a self-certifying compressor and emits a soundness certificate or failure report.
- R3d: `CertificateFixedPointIterator` — Repeatedly applies the compression-verification cycle to a certificate chain until fixed-point convergence is detected.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- R4a: `RecursiveCertificateTerminationProof` — Proves that a recursive certificate seed completed its expansion within the declared depth bound.
- R4b: `FractalProofIsomorphismSeal` — Certifies that sub-proofs maintain structural isomorphism with the parent at all generated levels.
- R4c: `SelfCertificationSoundnessReceipt` — Attests that a self-certifying compressor's internal verification met or exceeded the global pipeline's strictness.
