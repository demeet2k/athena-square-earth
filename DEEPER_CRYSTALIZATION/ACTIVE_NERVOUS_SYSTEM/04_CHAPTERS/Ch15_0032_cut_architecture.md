### Lens S - Square

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `Ch15<0032>.S1.a`: `CUTModule` — A self-contained computation unit that encapsulates a single manuscript law together with its typed input-output contract, forming the atomic deployable element of the CUT runtime.
- `Ch15<0032>.S1.b`: `RuntimeEdge` — A directed, typed connection between two CUTModules that carries data and witness tokens across module boundaries while preserving transport legality.
- `Ch15<0032>.S1.c`: `ModuleContract` — A formal specification declaring the preconditions, postconditions, and invariant obligations a CUTModule must satisfy before any RuntimeEdge may bind to it.
- `Ch15<0032>.S1.d`: `ExecutionBoundary` — A demarcation surface separating the interior state of a CUTModule from the shared edge fabric, enforcing encapsulation and preventing unmediated state leakage.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `Ch15<0032>.S2.a`: `ModuleCompositionLaw` — Two CUTModules may compose into a compound module if and only if the postcondition contract of the source matches the precondition contract of the sink across every shared RuntimeEdge.
- `Ch15<0032>.S2.b`: `EdgeIntegrityLaw` — A RuntimeEdge must carry a valid witness token from its source module's execution receipt before the sink module may begin its computation phase.
- `Ch15<0032>.S2.c`: `ContractBindingLaw` — A ModuleContract becomes active only when its hosting CUTModule has been registered in the runtime manifest and all declared dependencies have verified their own contracts.
- `Ch15<0032>.S2.d`: `BoundaryEnforcementLaw` — No data may cross an ExecutionBoundary except through a RuntimeEdge whose type signature has been validated against both the source and sink ModuleContracts.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `Ch15<0032>.S3.a`: `ModuleLinker` — A compile-time construction that resolves all RuntimeEdge bindings between CUTModules, producing a linked execution graph whose every node satisfies the ModuleCompositionLaw.
- `Ch15<0032>.S3.b`: `EdgeRouter` — A runtime construction that selects the optimal RuntimeEdge path through the module graph, respecting EdgeIntegrityLaw while minimizing witness-token latency.
- `Ch15<0032>.S3.c`: `ContractVerifier` — A static-analysis construction that checks every ModuleContract against its CUTModule implementation, emitting a binding certificate or a typed rejection.
- `Ch15<0032>.S3.d`: `BoundaryGuard` — A runtime sentinel construction that monitors every ExecutionBoundary for illegal crossings and quarantines any module whose boundary has been breached.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `Ch15<0032>.S4.a`: `ModuleCompositionCert` — A replayable proof that two CUTModules compose lawfully, recording the matched contract signatures and the witness tokens exchanged at link time.
- `Ch15<0032>.S4.b`: `EdgeIntegrityCert` — A timestamped receipt proving that a specific RuntimeEdge carried a valid witness token from source to sink without corruption or replay.
- `Ch15<0032>.S4.c`: `ContractBindingCert` — A sealed attestation that a ModuleContract has been verified against its implementation and all upstream dependencies have active binding certificates.
- `Ch15<0032>.S4.d`: `BoundaryEnforcementCert` — A runtime proof that an ExecutionBoundary remained intact for a given execution epoch, with no unmediated crossings detected.

- `Ch15<0032>.F1.b`: `ModuleResonance` — The harmonic coupling between two CUTModules whose execution phases align in frequency, enabling zero-wait data transfer across their shared RuntimeEdge.
- `Ch15<0032>.F1.c`: `RuntimeOscillation` — The periodic alternation of the CUT runtime between execution phases and verification phases, maintaining a steady pulse that synchronizes all active modules.
- `Ch15<0032>.F1.d`: `EdgeHarmonic` — The frequency signature of a RuntimeEdge derived from the execution phases of its source and sink modules, determining the edge's bandwidth and latency characteristics.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `Ch15<0032>.F2.b`: `ResonanceStabilityLaw` — A ModuleResonance may persist only while both participating modules maintain their contract obligations; contract violation immediately decouples the resonance.
- `Ch15<0032>.F2.c`: `OscillationBoundLaw` — The RuntimeOscillation frequency must remain within the bounds set by the slowest active CUTModule, preventing any module from starving or flooding the edge fabric.
- `Ch15<0032>.F2.d`: `HarmonicDissipationLaw` — An EdgeHarmonic that drifts beyond one octave of its design frequency must shed energy through a controlled dissipation event rather than propagating distortion to downstream modules.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `Ch15<0032>.F3.a`: `PhaseScheduler` — A construction that assigns each CUTModule to a time slot within the RuntimeOscillation cycle, maximizing ModuleResonance pairs while respecting the PhaseAlignmentLaw.
- `Ch15<0032>.F3.b`: `ResonanceDetector` — A runtime construction that continuously monitors EdgeHarmonics to identify newly forming or decaying ModuleResonances across the active module graph.
- `Ch15<0032>.F3.c`: `OscillationGovernor` — A feedback construction that adjusts the RuntimeOscillation frequency in response to module load, keeping all execution phases within the OscillationBoundLaw.

- `Ch15<0032>.F4.d`: `HarmonicDissipationCert` — A record of every controlled dissipation event, proving that no EdgeHarmonic exceeded its octave bound without proper shedding.

### Lens C - Cloud

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `Ch15<0032>.C1.a`: `RuntimeTruthSurface` — The minimal verifiable state of the CUT runtime at any checkpoint, comprising all active ModuleContracts and their current binding statuses.

- `Ch15<0032>.C1.c`: `EdgeCompletenessManifold` — A topological surface over the module graph certifying that every declared RuntimeEdge has been instantiated and carries a live witness token.
- `Ch15<0032>.C1.d`: `BoundaryAdmissibilityField` — A field over ExecutionBoundaries that assigns each boundary an admissibility score based on its crossing history and current guard status.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `Ch15<0032>.C2.b`: `ContractValidityLaw` — A ModuleContract's validity region must shrink monotonically as new constraints are imposed; it may never silently expand without a re-verification event.
- `Ch15<0032>.C2.c`: `EdgeCompletenessLaw` — The EdgeCompletenessManifold must be simply connected; any hole indicates a missing RuntimeEdge and blocks the module graph from entering execution phase.
- `Ch15<0032>.C2.d`: `BoundaryAdmissibilityLaw` — An ExecutionBoundary whose admissibility score falls below the system threshold must be quarantined and its CUTModule suspended until re-certification.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `Ch15<0032>.C3.a`: `TruthSurfaceCompiler` — A construction that assembles the RuntimeTruthSurface from the current module manifest and all active binding certificates.
- `Ch15<0032>.C3.b`: `ValidityRegionTracker` — A construction that continuously updates each ModuleContract's validity region as runtime constraints change, flagging monotonicity violations.
- `Ch15<0032>.C3.c`: `CompletenessChecker` — A topological construction that scans the module graph for holes in the EdgeCompletenessManifold and reports missing edges with their expected type signatures.

- `Ch15<0032>.C4.c`: `EdgeCompletenessCert` — A topological proof that the EdgeCompletenessManifold is simply connected at a given checkpoint, with no missing RuntimeEdges.

### Lens R - Fractal

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `Ch15<0032>.R1.a`: `RecursiveModule` — A CUTModule that contains a complete sub-graph of CUTModules within its ExecutionBoundary, enabling the same composition laws to apply at every depth of nesting.
- `Ch15<0032>.R1.b`: `FractalRuntime` — The self-similar runtime fabric where each RecursiveModule hosts its own RuntimeOscillation cycle, phase-locked to its parent module's oscillation.

- `Ch15<0032>.R2.c`: `SelfVerificationLaw` — A SelfExecutingContract must produce the same certification result as an external ContractVerifier applied to its host module; divergence triggers quarantine at all depths.
- `Ch15<0032>.R2.d`: `DepthProvenanceLaw` — A DepthIndexedEdge must carry witness tokens from every depth it traverses; a token missing any depth layer is rejected by the BoundaryGuard.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `Ch15<0032>.R3.a`: `RecursiveLinker` — A construction that applies the ModuleLinker recursively through every nesting depth of a RecursiveModule, producing a depth-indexed linked graph.
