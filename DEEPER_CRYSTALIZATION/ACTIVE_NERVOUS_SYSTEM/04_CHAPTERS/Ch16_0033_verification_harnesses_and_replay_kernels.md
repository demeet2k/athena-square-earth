### Lens S - Square

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `Ch16<0033>.S1.a`: `ReplaySurface` — A deterministic re-execution environment that accepts a sequence of witness tokens and reproduces the exact computation path that originally generated them, enabling bit-exact verification.
- `Ch16<0033>.S1.b`: `VerificationLayer` — A dedicated stratum of the runtime stack whose sole purpose is to accept computation receipts and confirm their consistency with the manuscript's declared laws.
- `Ch16<0033>.S1.c`: `HonestyMeter` — A quantitative instrument that measures the divergence between a module's declared behavior and its observed output across a replay window, producing a scalar honesty score.
- `Ch16<0033>.S1.d`: `RecursionGuard` — A depth-counting sentinel that prevents verification loops from exceeding a declared recursion bound, halting and reporting when the bound is reached.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `Ch16<0033>.S2.a`: `ReplayDeterminismLaw` — A ReplaySurface must produce identical outputs for identical witness-token sequences regardless of when or where the replay is executed.
- `Ch16<0033>.S2.b`: `VerificationCompleteLaw` — Every computation receipt submitted to a VerificationLayer must receive either a confirmation or a typed rejection; silent drops are forbidden.
- `Ch16<0033>.S2.c`: `HonestyObligationLaw` — Any module whose HonestyMeter score falls below the system-declared threshold must halt execution and submit to re-verification before resuming.
- `Ch16<0033>.S2.d`: `RecursionBoundLaw` — The RecursionGuard's depth bound must be declared before verification begins and may not be increased during an active verification session.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `Ch16<0033>.S3.a`: `ReplayKernel` — A minimal execution kernel that strips all non-deterministic inputs and replays a computation using only the stored witness-token sequence and initial state snapshot.
- `Ch16<0033>.S3.b`: `VerificationHarness` — A test-framework construction that wraps any CUTModule in a VerificationLayer, injecting known inputs and comparing outputs against expected receipts.
- `Ch16<0033>.S3.c`: `HonestyAuditor` — A construction that periodically samples module outputs, feeds them to the HonestyMeter, and escalates to quarantine if the honesty score trends below threshold.
- `Ch16<0033>.S3.d`: `RecursionDepthTracker` — A construction that instruments every verification call with a depth counter, enforcing the RecursionBoundLaw and emitting a depth-exceeded alert on violation.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `Ch16<0033>.S4.a`: `ReplayFidelityCert` — A proof that a ReplaySurface reproduced the original computation's outputs with bit-exact fidelity for a given witness-token sequence.
- `Ch16<0033>.S4.b`: `VerificationCompleteCert` — A receipt confirming that every computation receipt in a batch received either confirmation or typed rejection from the VerificationLayer.
- `Ch16<0033>.S4.c`: `HonestyScoreCert` — A timestamped attestation of a module's HonestyMeter score, including the sample window and the inputs used for measurement.
- `Ch16<0033>.S4.d`: `RecursionBoundCert` — A proof that a verification session completed without exceeding the declared recursion depth bound at any point during execution.

### Lens F - Flower

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `Ch16<0033>.F1.a`: `VerificationResonance` — The harmonic state achieved when a ReplaySurface and its originating runtime synchronize their execution phases, enabling live cross-checking.
- `Ch16<0033>.F1.b`: `ReplayHarmonic` — The frequency signature of a replay cycle, derived from the witness-token arrival rate and the ReplayKernel's processing speed.
- `Ch16<0033>.F1.c`: `HonestyPhase` — The temporal window within each RuntimeOscillation cycle dedicated exclusively to HonestyMeter sampling and score computation.
- `Ch16<0033>.F1.d`: `VerificationPulse` — A periodic signal emitted by the VerificationLayer that triggers all registered modules to submit their latest computation receipts for checking.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `Ch16<0033>.F2.a`: `ResonanceSyncLaw` — VerificationResonance must be established before any live cross-checking begins; unsynchronized verification attempts are rejected.
- `Ch16<0033>.F2.b`: `ReplayHarmonicLaw` — The ReplayHarmonic frequency must be an integer multiple of the original execution frequency to prevent aliasing artifacts in the replayed computation.
- `Ch16<0033>.F2.c`: `HonestyPhaseLaw` — The HonestyPhase must not overlap with any module's active execution phase, ensuring that honesty measurement does not perturb the computation being measured.
- `Ch16<0033>.F2.d`: `VerificationPulseLaw` — Every VerificationPulse must reach all registered modules within a single oscillation cycle; modules that miss a pulse are flagged for priority re-verification.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `Ch16<0033>.C2.b`: `VerificationCompletenessLaw` — The VerificationCompletenessManifold must cover the entire active module graph; any unverified hole blocks system-level certification.
- `Ch16<0033>.C2.c`: `HonestyCorridorLaw` — The system may continue execution only while the HonestyCorridor is non-empty; if all modules fail honesty, the system must enter quarantine.
- `Ch16<0033>.C2.d`: `RecursionAdmissibilityLaw` — The RecursionAdmissibilityField must assign zero admissibility to any depth beyond the system-declared maximum, making deeper recursion structurally impossible.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `Ch16<0033>.C3.b`: `CompletenessMapper` — A construction that continuously surveys the module graph and updates the VerificationCompletenessManifold, highlighting unverified regions.
- `Ch16<0033>.C3.c`: `CorridorMonitor` — A construction that tracks all active HonestyMeter scores and computes the current extent of the HonestyCorridor in real time.

### Lens R - Fractal

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `Ch16<0033>.R1.a`: `RecursiveVerifier` — A VerificationLayer that contains an embedded VerificationLayer, enabling verification of verification itself at arbitrary nesting depths.
- `Ch16<0033>.R1.b`: `FractalReplay` — A replay structure where each ReplaySurface contains sub-replays of its own verification steps, creating a self-documenting verification cascade.

- `Ch16<0033>.R2.b`: `FractalReplayLaw` — Every sub-replay within a FractalReplay must independently satisfy the ReplayDeterminismLaw, and their collective result must equal the parent replay's result.
- `Ch16<0033>.R2.c`: `SelfHonestyLaw` — A SelfHonestSurface's meta-honesty score must be at least as high as any module-level honesty score it reports; a less-honest meter cannot certify more-honest modules.
- `Ch16<0033>.R2.d`: `DepthTerminationLaw` — Every DepthBoundedVerificationTree must terminate at the declared depth bound with a leaf certificate; infinite verification descent is structurally prohibited.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `Ch16<0033>.R3.a`: `MetaVerifier` — A construction that instantiates a RecursiveVerifier at each nesting depth and cross-checks their results against the non-recursive baseline.
