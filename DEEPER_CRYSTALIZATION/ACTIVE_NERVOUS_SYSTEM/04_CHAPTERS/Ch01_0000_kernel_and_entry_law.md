## Crystal tile

### Lens S - Square
`[⊙Z_0↔Z* | ○Arc 0 | ○Rot 0 | △Lane Su | ⧈View S | ω=0]`

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `Ch01<0000>.S1.a` `ParseKernel` — The indivisible computational seed that accepts or rejects every incoming token stream, guaranteeing that only well-formed inputs cross the tome boundary.
- `Ch01<0000>.S1.b` `EntryLaw` — The axiomatic gate predicate that every agent, document, or signal must satisfy before being admitted into the crystal lattice.
- `Ch01<0000>.S1.c` `CharterSeal` — The immutable identity stamp binding a private charter to its originating author, preventing forgery or unauthorized scope mutation.
- `Ch01<0000>.S1.d` `PrivateScope` — The isolation boundary that confines a charter's operational reach to its declared namespace, blocking cross-scope leakage.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `Ch01<0000>.S2.a` `ParseSafetyLaw` — Every token stream entering the kernel must be deterministically classifiable as ACCEPT or REJECT within bounded computation steps.
- `Ch01<0000>.S2.b` `EntryValidationLaw` — No entity may bypass the entry gate; admission requires a witness-stamped proof of well-formedness that the kernel can verify in constant time.
- `Ch01<0000>.S2.c` `CharterBindingLaw` — A charter, once sealed, cannot be modified without producing a new version hash; the original seal remains an immutable historical record.
- `Ch01<0000>.S2.d` `ScopeIsolationLaw` — Operations within a private scope cannot read from, write to, or signal any namespace outside its declared boundary without an explicit tunnel permit.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `Ch01<0000>.S3.a` `buildKernel()` — Assembles the parse kernel from the base axiom set, wiring the token classifier, rejection log, and acceptance registry into a single boot sequence.
- `Ch01<0000>.S3.b` `validateEntry()` — Executes the entry law predicate against an incoming entity, producing either an admission receipt or a typed rejection with diagnostic trace.
- `Ch01<0000>.S3.c` `sealCharter()` — Computes the cryptographic seal over a charter's content, author identity, and timestamp, binding all three into a tamper-evident capsule.
- `Ch01<0000>.S3.d` `isolateScope()` — Instantiates a private namespace container with hard walls, injecting only the explicitly declared dependency set and blocking all ambient references.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- `Ch01<0000>.S4.b` `Cert_Entry_Valid` — Attests that an entity passed the entry law predicate with a complete witness trace that any future auditor can replay.
- `Ch01<0000>.S4.c` `Cert_Charter_Sealed` — Attests that a charter's seal matches its content hash and that no post-seal mutation has occurred.
- `Ch01<0000>.S4.d` `Cert_Scope_Isolated` — Attests that a private scope operated without any cross-boundary reads, writes, or signals during its entire lifecycle.
