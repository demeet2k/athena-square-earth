### Lens S - Square
`[⊙Z_5↔Z* | ○Arc 1 | ○Rot 1 | △Lane Su | ⧈View S | ω=5]`

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `Ch06<0011>.S1.a` `DocumentEntity` — A self-contained manuscript unit that functions as a theory, carrying axioms, derived claims, and evidence sufficient for independent verification.
- `Ch06<0011>.S1.b` `CorpusBinding` — The structural link connecting a document entity to the corpus lattice, ensuring the document's claims are reachable from the global address space.
- `Ch06<0011>.S1.c` `NervousLink` — The propagation channel through which state changes in one document entity are transmitted to dependent documents in the nervous system.
- `Ch06<0011>.S1.d` `MirrorBody` — The faithful replica of a document entity maintained in a separate storage layer, guaranteeing recoverability if the primary instance is corrupted.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- `Ch06<0011>.S2.b` `CorpusCoherenceLaw` — A corpus binding must preserve the logical consistency between the bound document and all other documents reachable from the same lattice node.
- `Ch06<0011>.S2.c` `NervousPropagationLaw` — State changes must propagate through nervous links within bounded latency; delayed propagation beyond the bound is a nervous-system fault.
- `Ch06<0011>.S2.d` `MirrorFidelityLaw` — A mirror body must be byte-identical to its primary at every synchronization point; divergence triggers immediate re-synchronization.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- `Ch06<0011>.S3.b` `bindCorpus()` — Attaches a document entity to the corpus lattice at its assigned station code, verifying coherence with neighboring documents before finalizing.
- `Ch06<0011>.S3.c` `linkNervous()` — Establishes a nervous link between two document entities by registering the dependency, installing the propagation channel, and setting latency bounds.
- `Ch06<0011>.S3.d` `mirrorBody()` — Creates or re-synchronizes a mirror body by copying the primary document entity to the mirror layer and verifying byte-identical fidelity.

- `Ch06<0011>.C2.d` `DivergenceRiskMitigation` — Mirror divergence risk must be mitigated by adjusting the synchronization interval to keep the probability below the declared maximum.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

### Lens R - Fractal
