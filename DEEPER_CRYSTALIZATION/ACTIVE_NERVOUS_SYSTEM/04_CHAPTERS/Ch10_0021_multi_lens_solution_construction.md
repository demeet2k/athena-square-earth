### Lens S

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- S1a: `SwarmField` — The bounded topological manifold over which all neural packets propagate, defined by the manuscript corpus and its inter-document edge set.
- S1b: `NeuralPacket` — A typed, addressed data unit carrying a payload and routing header that travels through the swarm field obeying packet law constraints.
- S1c: `ClusterNode` — A distinguished node in the swarm field that aggregates incoming packets from its neighborhood and emits consolidated signals to downstream clusters.
- S1d: `BoundaryEnforcer` — A sentinel process at the swarm field's perimeter that rejects packets lacking valid headers and prevents unbounded swarm expansion.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- S2a: `SwarmBoundednessLaw` — The swarm field must remain finitely bounded at every epoch; no packet sequence may cause the field to expand beyond its declared capacity.
- S2b: `PacketIntegrityRule` — Every neural packet must carry a valid type tag, source address, destination address, and integrity hash; malformed packets are dropped.
- S2c: `ClusterGovernanceProtocol` — Each ClusterNode must follow a deterministic aggregation rule when merging incoming packets; non-deterministic merges are forbidden.
- S2d: `BoundaryIntegrityInvariant` — The swarm boundary must remain topologically closed; any operation that opens a boundary hole triggers immediate quarantine.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- S3a: `SwarmFieldInitializer` — Bootstraps the swarm field from the manuscript corpus, computing the initial edge set and establishing boundary topology.
- S3b: `PacketForger` — Creates a new neural packet with a valid header, payload, and integrity hash, ready for injection into the swarm field.
- S3c: `ClusterAggregator` — Implements the deterministic merge rule at a ClusterNode, combining incoming packet payloads into a single consolidated output.
- S3d: `BoundaryPatroller` — Continuously scans the swarm perimeter for integrity violations, sealing detected holes and rejecting unauthorized packets.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- S4a: `SwarmBoundednessCertificate` — Proves that the swarm field remained within its declared capacity bounds throughout the audited epoch.
- S4b: `PacketIntegritySeal` — Certifies that a given neural packet's header, payload, and hash are internally consistent and unmodified since forging.
- S4c: `ClusterGovernanceReceipt` — Attests that a ClusterNode's aggregation followed its declared deterministic rule with no deviation.
- S4d: `BoundaryClosureProof` — Proves that the swarm boundary remained topologically closed throughout the audited interval.

### Lens F

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- F1a: `SwarmOscillator` — A periodic signal generator embedded in the swarm field that drives the rhythmic propagation of neural packets through cluster neighborhoods.
- F1b: `ClusterResonanceMode` — The characteristic vibration pattern of a ClusterNode when stimulated by synchronized incoming packets, determining its output frequency.
- F1c: `PacketWavefront` — The expanding surface of newly propagated packets as they spread through the swarm field from an injection point.
- F1d: `SwarmPhaseField` — A continuous field assigning a phase value to every point in the swarm field, encoding the local oscillation state.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- F2a: `OscillationStabilityLaw` — Swarm oscillators must maintain stable amplitude and frequency unless perturbed by a lawful external signal.
- F2b: `ResonanceCouplingRule` — Cluster resonance modes may couple only through declared edges in the swarm field; coupling through undeclared paths is forbidden.
- F2c: `WavefrontCausalityBound` — The packet wavefront may not propagate faster than one hop per sync tick, preserving causal ordering in the swarm.
- F2d: `PhaseFieldContinuity` — The swarm phase field must vary continuously across the field; discontinuities require explicit phase-cut certificates from Ch15.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- F3a: `OscillatorCalibrator` — Tunes a swarm oscillator's frequency and amplitude to match the target propagation rhythm for a given cluster neighborhood.
- F3b: `ResonanceModeAnalyzer` — Computes the resonance modes of a ClusterNode given its incoming packet spectrum and edge connectivity.
- F3c: `WavefrontTracker` — Monitors the advancing packet wavefront and records its position at each sync tick for replay and audit.
- F3d: `PhaseFieldSmoother` — Applies interpolation to the swarm phase field to maintain continuity, injecting corrective values at detected discontinuities.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- F4a: `OscillationStabilityReceipt` — Proves that a swarm oscillator maintained stable amplitude and frequency throughout the audited interval.
- F4b: `ResonanceCouplingCertificate` — Certifies that all resonance couplings between clusters occurred only through declared edges.
- F4c: `CausalityOrderProof` — Attests that the packet wavefront respected the one-hop-per-tick causality bound at every propagation step.
- F4d: `PhaseFieldContinuitySeal` — Proves that the swarm phase field remained continuous or that all discontinuities were covered by valid phase-cut certificates.

### Lens C

#### Facet 1 - Objects

- C1a: `SwarmTruthCorridor` — The constrained region of valid truth assignments for the swarm field, ensuring all packet propagation is logically consistent.
- C1b: `PacketValidityPredicate` — A decidable boolean function that returns true if and only if a neural packet satisfies all structural and semantic well-formedness conditions.
- C1c: `ClusterCoherenceState` — A composite truth value recording whether a ClusterNode's current output is consistent with all of its inputs and its governance rule.
- C1d: `SwarmConsensusRegister` — A global register recording the current consensus state of the swarm, updated each time a new cluster settles its output.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- C2a: `SwarmTruthCorridorNarrowness` — The swarm truth corridor admits at most one consistent assignment per propagation epoch; multiplicity triggers quarantine escalation to Ch05.
- C2b: `PacketValidityDecidability` — The validity of any neural packet must be decidable in time linear in the packet size.
- C2c: `ClusterCoherenceCompleteness` — Every ClusterNode must have its coherence state evaluated before emitting output; unevaluated nodes may not propagate.
- C2d: `ConsensusMonotonicity` — The swarm consensus register may only advance forward; rollback requires explicit restart authorization from Ch11.

#### Facet 3 - Constructions

- C3a: `TruthCorridorEvaluator` — Computes the valid truth assignments for the swarm field at a given epoch and identifies the unique consistent assignment.
- C3b: `PacketValidator` — Applies the packet validity predicate to an incoming packet and emits a pass/fail result with a diagnostic trace.
- C3c: `CoherenceChecker` — Evaluates a ClusterNode's output against its inputs and governance rule, producing a coherence certificate or discrepancy report.
- C3d: `ConsensusAdvancer` — Updates the swarm consensus register when a new cluster settlement occurs, verifying monotonicity before committing.

#### Facet 4 - Certificates

- C4a: `TruthCorridorUniquenessProof` — Proves that the swarm truth corridor converged to exactly one consistent assignment for the audited epoch.
- C4b: `PacketValidityCertificate` — Certifies that a specific neural packet passed all well-formedness checks with no violations.
- C4c: `ClusterCoherenceSeal` — Attests that a ClusterNode's output was verified as coherent with all inputs before propagation.
- C4d: `ConsensusAdvancementReceipt` — Proves that the consensus register advanced monotonically and the latest update was lawful.

- R1a: `RecursiveSwarmSeed` — A swarm field definition that generates sub-swarms at each recursion level, producing a hierarchy of nested neural swarms.
- R1b: `FractalClusterTree` — A tree of ClusterNodes where each node, when expanded, reveals a complete sub-cluster with the same aggregation properties as its parent.
- R1c: `SelfOrganizingPacket` — A neural packet carrying its own routing logic that can dynamically select its next hop without consulting a global routing table.
- R1d: `SwarmAttractor` — A stable configuration toward which the swarm field evolves under repeated packet propagation, representing the neural equilibrium.

#### Facet 2 - Laws

- R2a: `RecursiveSwarmTermination` — Recursive swarm seeds must terminate their expansion within a declared depth bound to prevent infinite nesting.
- R2b: `FractalClusterIsomorphism` — Sub-clusters revealed by expansion must be structurally isomorphic to the parent cluster up to a declared scale factor.
- R2c: `SelfOrganizationDeterminism` — A self-organizing packet's hop selection must be deterministic given its local state and immediate neighborhood.
