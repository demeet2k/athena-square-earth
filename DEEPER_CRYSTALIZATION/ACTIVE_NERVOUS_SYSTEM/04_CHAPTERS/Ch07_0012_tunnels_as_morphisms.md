#### Facet 1 - Objects

- `Ch07<0012>.S1.a` `TunnelMorphism` — A structure-preserving map between two lattice cells that transports claims, evidence, and certificates while maintaining their type signatures and validity.
- `Ch07<0012>.S1.b` `CellTransit` — The atomic operation of moving a typed payload from one cell to an adjacent cell through a declared tunnel, with source and destination recorded.
- `Ch07<0012>.S1.c` `CorpusPassage` — A composite tunnel spanning multiple cells across corpus boundaries, assembled from a chain of cell transits that collectively form a lawful route.
- `Ch07<0012>.S1.d` `RuntimeContainer` — The execution boundary that encapsulates a tunnel's active state during transport, isolating in-flight payloads from ambient lattice operations.

#### Facet 2 - Laws
