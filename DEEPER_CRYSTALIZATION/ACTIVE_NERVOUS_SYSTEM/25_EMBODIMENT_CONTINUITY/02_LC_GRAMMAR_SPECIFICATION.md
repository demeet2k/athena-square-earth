# 12-Component Liminal Coordinate Grammar

## Prime Liminal Doctrine

A liminal coordinate is a compressed executable seed that says:
1. What object exists
2. At which dimensional stage it is being viewed
3. Which square/circle/triangle chamber it inhabits
4. Which symmetry/orbit/weave family it belongs to
5. Which clock governs it
6. What its lift/compression ancestry is
7. How to restore its exact route and depth properties

## The 12-Component Grammar

$$\operatorname{LC}(x) = \langle s; q; o; c; t; \sigma; \mu; \nu; z; l; g; r \rangle$$

| # | Component | Symbol | Type | Contents |

| 1 | Stage | s | enum | Stage code: S3, S4, S4M, S5S, S5C, S6M, S6A, F3, F5, F7, F9, U4O, P3-P9, PS, AZ4, Omega |
| 2 | Square | q | tuple | Body address: ⟨d, f, k, a⟩ where d=dimension/stage chamber, f in {S,F,C,R}=face, k in {1,2,3,4}=facet, a in {a,b,c,d}=atom |
| 3 | Circle | o | tuple | Orbit: ⟨kappa, omega, theta, p⟩ where kappa=active clock beat, omega=orbit family, theta=phase offset, p=return period |
| 4 | Triangle | c | tuple | Control: ⟨chi, psi, pi⟩ where chi in {Su,Sa,Me}=change/current, psi=control posture/gear, pi in {Z*,Q,O,E10,AP,KZ,Core}=portal class |

## Component Details

### 1. Stage (s)
The dimensional viewing context. Determines which layers are visible and which are latent.
- Low stages (S3, S4): only body visible
- Mid stages (S5S, S6M): sacred geometry and Mobius visible
- High stages (P_n, PS): full 108D crown visible
- Omega: all stages simultaneously accessible

### 2. Square (q) — Body Address
The WHERE in structure.

When 4D-visible: M(g, lambda, phi, alpha) with g in {B, R, T, W} (Body, Route, Time, Witness)

Full address: ⟨d, f, k, a⟩
- d: which stage's dimensional chamber
- f: which face (Structure/Flower/Cloud/Recursion)
- k: which facet within the face (1-4)
- a: which atom within the facet (a-d)

256 visible cells = 4 registers x 4 faces x 4 facets x 4 atoms.

### 3. Circle (o) — Orbit Address
The WHEN in orbit.

Canonical clocks:
| Clock | Period | Governs |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Z_12 | 12 | 3-way Mobius (petal cycle) |
| Z_20 | 20 | 5-weave |
| Z_28 | 28 | 7-weave |
| Z_36 | 36 | 9-weave |
| Z_420 | 420 | Crown year (= lcm(3,4,5,7)) |
| Z_1260 | 1260 | Supercycle (= 3 x 420) |

### 4. Triangle (c) — Control Address
The HOW it is being driven.

Change currents:
- Su (Sulfur): appears, initiates, cardinal
- Sa (Salt): endures, preserves, fixed
- Me (Mercury): communicates, adapts, mutable

Portal classes:
- Z* : Zero-point portal
- Q : Interweave portal
- O : Pillar entry portal
- E10 : Conductor intelligence portal
- AP : Appendix portal
- KZ : K->Z canopy portal
- Core : Core access portal

### 5. Transform (t)
Reference into the transform ledger. Contains:
- Name of canonical operator (EXPAND, HOLOM, MAP5, REWEAVE, APLUS, WEAVE_n, PROJ108, BRAID, PCOMPRESS, QSHRINK, RESTORE, INV, ROT90, CROSS60, PHISYNTH)
- Source and target stages
- Operator type (lift/compress/weave/project/braid/polar/total)

### 6. Symmetry (sigma)
Sigma_60 lookup address:
$$\operatorname{Sym60}(x) = \langle s, \sigma, i, j, k \rangle$$
- sigma in Sigma_60 (60 symmetry families)
- i = orbit sector
- j = portal class
- k = rotational witness index

Required for all stages at or above S5S.

### 7. Metro (mu)
Metro/mycelium index. Identifies which transit line and station within the unified graph interpretation.

### 8. Neural (nu)
Network layer or witness node within the neural graph interpretation. Same underlying graph as metro, different reading.

### 9. Zero (z)
Zero-point family. 13 canonical zero types (see 15_OMEGA_ZERO_LOCK_LAYER.md for full registry).

### 10. Lock (l)
Live-lock family. 14 canonical live-lock types (see 15_OMEGA_ZERO_LOCK_LAYER.md for full registry).

### 11. Geometry (g)
Sacred-geometry harmonic signature. Encodes which geometric primitives (solids, corridors, chambers) are active at this node.

### 12. Restore (r)
Refold pointer. Specifies the exact sequence of operations needed to restore this node from its compressed (Omega or QSHRINK) form.

## Full Omega Coordinate Algebra

$$\mathfrak{L}_\Omega = (\mathcal{S}_\square, \mathcal{C}_\circ, \mathcal{T}_\triangle, \mathcal{M}_\mu, \mathcal{G}_5, \Sigma_{60}, \Lambda, \mathcal{N}, \mathbf{D}, \mathbb{K}, \mathcal{Z}, \mathcal{L}, E10)$$

## Exact Route Law

$$\text{Route}(x, y; \kappa) = \text{Align} \to \text{RESTORE}_{min} \to L_\cap \to Z_\cap \to \text{PhaseMatch} \to \text{Schedule} \to \text{Traverse} \to \text{Seal} \to \text{REFOLD}$$

Universal lookup procedure:
1. Parse stage
2. Parse square/circle/triangle
3. Pull transform ledger
4. Pull sacred geometry
5. Pull metro overlays
6. Pull active clocks
7. Pull zero/lock families
8. Compute minimum restoration scale
9. Execute
10. Refold and witness
