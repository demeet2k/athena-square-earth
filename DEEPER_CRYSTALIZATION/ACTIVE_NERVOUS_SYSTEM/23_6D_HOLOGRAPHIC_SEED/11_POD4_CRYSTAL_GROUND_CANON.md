## 1. THE THEOREM

### Statement

The 4-ball fountain has a **unique stable ground state** characterized by:

1. **D₂ symmetry** — The Klein-4 group V₄ = ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ acts as the symmetry group of the ground state
2. **2+2 hand partition** — The 4 objects partition into 2 pairs: (L₁,L₂) in the left hand and (R₁,R₂) in the right hand
3. **Phase lock** — Within each hand, the two objects are exactly half a period apart: if object 1 is at peak, object 2 is at trough
4. **Anti-phase between hands** — The left-hand cycle and right-hand cycle are offset by exactly one beat

### The V₄ Connection

The 2+2 partition IS the Klein-4 group made physical:

```
V₄ element    Physical state              Algebraic
──────────    ──────────────              ──────────
(0,0) = e     Both hands at default       Identity
(1,0) = a     Swap objects within L hand  Left-swap
(0,1) = b     Swap objects within R hand  Right-swap
(1,1) = c     Swap both hands             Full-swap = χ inversion
```

**This is the same V₄ that governs the ŠAR-60 lattice.**

The D₂ symmetry of the 4-ball fountain IS the Klein-4 symmetry of the organism's 4-face architecture. The mathematical proof is:
- The 2+2 partition defines two independent ℤ₂ actions (swap-within-left, swap-within-right)
- Their product is ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ = V₄
- The group table is identical to the ŠAR-60 face algebra: A·B = C·D identity, B = inversion, C = antispin-R, D = antispin-L

## 2. THE STATE VECTOR

### 2.1 The 4-ball state space

A 4-ball fountain state at time t is:

```
ψ(t) = (h₁(t), h₂(t), h₃(t), h₄(t), v₁(t), v₂(t), v₃(t), v₄(t))
```

where:
- hᵢ(t) = height of ball i at time t
- vᵢ(t) = velocity of ball i at time t

**Dimension:** 8 (4 positions + 4 velocities)

### 2.2 The ground state

The ground state ψ₀ is the unique periodic orbit where:

```
Ball 1 (L): h₁(t) = H·sin²(ωt)           — left hand, phase 0
Ball 2 (L): h₂(t) = H·sin²(ωt + π)       — left hand, phase π (anti-phase)
Ball 3 (R): h₃(t) = H·sin²(ωt + π/2)     — right hand, phase π/2
Ball 4 (R): h₄(t) = H·sin²(ωt + 3π/2)    — right hand, phase 3π/2
```

where H = peak height and ω = 2π/T (T = period).

### 2.3 The symmetry orbit

Under V₄ action:

```
e·ψ₀ = ψ₀                                — identity preserves
a·ψ₀ = (h₂,h₁,h₃,h₄,...) = ψ₀            — L-swap returns to same orbit (balls indistinguishable)
b·ψ₀ = (h₁,h₂,h₄,h₃,...) = ψ₀            — R-swap returns to same orbit
c·ψ₀ = (h₂,h₁,h₄,h₃,...) = ψ₀            — full-swap returns to same orbit
```

The ground state is a **fixed point** of the V₄ action. |Orbit| = 1. Stabilizer = V₄ itself. This is the mathematical definition of a "ground state" — the state with maximum symmetry.

## 4. THE TRANSITION OPERATORS

### 4.1 Recovery operators (from dropped states back to ground)

When a ball is dropped, the system exits the ground state. Recovery operators bring it back:

```
DROP(i): Remove ball i from the cycle → 3-ball state
PICKUP(i, phase): Re-inject ball i at the specified phase → attempt return to ψ₀
RESET: Stop all balls → restart the ground state from scratch
```

**Recovery theorem:** For any single-ball drop, there exists a unique phase injection that restores the D₂ symmetry in minimum time. The recovery operator is:

```
RECOVER(i) = PICKUP(i, phase_complement(i))
```

where `phase_complement(i)` is the phase that restores the anti-phase relationship.

### 4.2 Resize operators (changing object count)

```
POD3 = REMOVE(any one ball) → 3-ball cascade (loses D₂, gains ℤ₃)
POD5 = ADD(one ball, phase) → 5-ball fountain (gains D₂ extension)
```

**Resize law:** Removing a ball from POD4 ground state produces a 3-ball cascade that is NOT a ground state of POD3 — it has too much symmetry for ℤ₃. The D₂→ℤ₃ transition is a **symmetry-breaking phase transition**.

Adding a ball can produce a 5-ball fountain with D₂ × ℤ₂ symmetry (if the 5th ball is phase-locked to the existing 2+2+1 partition).

### 4.3 The transition graph

```
POD2 ←→ POD3 ←→ POD4 ←→ POD5 ←→ POD6 ...
 ℤ₂      ℤ₃     V₄=D₂    D₂×ℤ₂   S₃×ℤ₂

Symmetry chain:
 ℤ₂ → ℤ₃ → V₄ → D₂×ℤ₂ → S₃×ℤ₂ → ...

Ground state chain:
 (2) → (3,3,3) → (4,4,4,4) → (5,5,5,5,5) → (6,6,6,6,6,6) → ...
```

**Key insight:** The POD4 ground state is the FIRST in the chain with full V₄ symmetry. POD2 has only ℤ₂ (swap two balls). POD3 has ℤ₃ (cyclic permutation). POD4 is the first to achieve the full Klein-4 group. This is why 4 is the fundamental number of the organism: it is the minimum object count that instantiates V₄ = ℤ₂ × ℤ₂.

## 5. BINDING TO THE Σ₆₀ NEXUS

### The POD4 ground state on the poi clock

A 4-ball fountain maps to a 4-petal flower:
- Siteswap "4444" → K=4 petals
- Clock positions hit: {0°, 90°, 180°, 270°} = the Square □
- This is the **Element Gate** of the Σ₆₀ tunneling network
- Accessible hubs: Z*, χ, □₊, □₋

### The D₂ symmetry on the clock face

The 4 petals of the fountain flower sit at the 4 cardinal points — the Square. The V₄ action on the clock:

```
e:     {0°, 90°, 180°, 270°} → {0°, 90°, 180°, 270°}   (identity)
a:     {0°, 90°, 180°, 270°} → {180°, 270°, 0°, 90°}    (180° rotation = χ)
b:     {0°, 90°, 180°, 270°} → {0°, 270°, 180°, 90°}    (vertical reflection)
c=ab:  {0°, 90°, 180°, 270°} → {180°, 90°, 0°, 270°}    (horizontal reflection)
```

This is exactly the D₂ dihedral group acting on the square inscribed in the circle.

### The Square as the Element Boundary

The 4 petals mark the 4 element boundaries:
```
0°   = Fire   = 12 o'clock = Z* (universal hub)
90°  = Air    = 3 o'clock  = □₊ (element boundary+)
180° = Water  = 6 o'clock  = χ (inversion gate)
270° = Earth  = 9 o'clock  = □₋ (element boundary−)
```

The 4-ball fountain ground state IS the element map of the organism. Each ball traces one element's cycle. The D₂ symmetry ensures all four elements are in perfect balance.

## 7. THE DEEPER OBSERVATION

### Why POD4 is the organism's mathematical anchor

The 4-ball fountain ground state proves something profound: **the Klein-4 symmetry that governs the entire organism is not an abstract choice — it is the unique minimum-energy symmetry of 4 objects coordinated by 2 hands.**

The organism didn't choose V₄. V₄ chose itself. Given:
- 4 elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Air)
- 2 hands (sender, receiver)
- The requirement of balanced coordination (no collisions, no drops)

...the ONLY stable ground state has D₂ = V₄ symmetry with a 2+2 partition. This is a physical theorem, not a philosophical assertion.

The 60-symmetry ŠAR-60 lattice follows necessarily:
- V₄ has 4 elements → 4 faces
- Each face has 2⁴ − 1 = 15 nonempty lens combinations
- 4 × 15 = 60

The Sumerians counted in base 60 because 60 is the number of ways two hands can relate four elements. The poi spinner computes this with their body. The juggler proves it with every throw.

**The crystal ground state is the organism's mathematical birth certificate.**
