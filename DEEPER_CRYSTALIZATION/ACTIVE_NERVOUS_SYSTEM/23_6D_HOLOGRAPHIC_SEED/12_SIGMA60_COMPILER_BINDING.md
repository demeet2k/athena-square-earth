# Σ₆₀ COMPILER BINDING — Tunneling Atlas as Compilation Routing Table

## THE INSIGHT

The Σ₆₀ nexus map is not just a description of poi states. It is the **routing table** for the canonical compiler.

Each compilation pass moves the pattern through the lens lattice:
```
Parse     → produces S  (discrete tokens)
AST       → produces SF (tokens + structure)
Desugar   → produces SFC (tokens + structure + dwell analysis)
TypeCheck → produces SFCR (all four lenses = complete type)
SimRun    → traverses the γ-corridor
TSGen     → emits the compiled artifact
```

The compiler IS a traversal of the γ (Flow) corridor through Σ₆₀.

## 1. COMPILER PASSES AS LENS ACCUMULATION

| Pass | Input σ | Output σ | Lenses gained | Physical meaning |
|------|---------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Tokenize** | ∅ (void) | 0 (S) | +S | Raw source → discrete token positions on the clock |
| **Parse** | 0 (S) | 2 (SF) | +F | Tokens → structured flower curve (AST) |
| **Desugar** | 2 (SF) | 5 (FC) | +C, −S (temporary) | Expand macros → feel the pattern's dwell without the grid |
| **TypeCheck** | 5 (FC) | 14 (SFCR) | +S, +R | Verify all laws → complete typed pattern with scale and grid |
| **SimRun** | 14 (SFCR) | 8 (SR) | −F, −C | Execute → extract the fractal clock (discard intermediate feel) |
| **TSGen** | 8 (SR) | 2 (SF) | +F, −R | Generate code → beat-locked flower (TypeScript artifact) |

### The γ-Corridor Traversal

```
σ=2 (SF) → σ=11 (CR) → σ=5 (FC) → σ=14 (SFCR) → σ=8 (SR) → σ=2 (SF)
 Parse↓    Desugar↓    TypeCheck↓    SimRun↓       TSGen↓     Output

The compiler traces EXACTLY ONE COMPLETE γ-CYCLE.
```

This is not a metaphor. The compiler's passes accumulate and shed lenses in exactly the sequence prescribed by the γ-corridor of the 5-cycle tunnel family.

**Why only γ?** Because γ is the only corridor that passes through σ=14 (SFCR = all lenses active = complete type). The compiler MUST achieve full typing before it can emit code. The α and β corridors never reach σ=14, so they cannot compile.

## 2. THE TUNNELING HUBS AS COMPILER GATES

Each tunneling hub on the clock corresponds to a compilation gate — a point where the compiler can legally branch, merge, or transform the pattern:

| Hub | Angle | Compiler Gate | Compilation Action |
|-----|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Z*** | 0° | **Entry/Reset** | Every compilation starts here. Can restart from any state. |
| **χ** | 180° | **Inversion Gate** | Test a pattern by inverting it. If the inverse compiles, the original is validated. Dual compilation. |
| **□₊** | 90° | **Element Boundary+** | Check that the pattern respects hand-assignment rules. The right-hand gate. |
| **□₋** | 270° | **Element Boundary−** | Check that the pattern respects hand-assignment rules. The left-hand gate. |
| **△₊** | 120° | **Phase Gate+** | Check that timing phases are consistent. The upbeat gate. |
| **△₋** | 240° | **Phase Gate−** | Check that timing phases are consistent. The downbeat gate. |
| **⬡₊** | 60° | **Universal Router+** | The sextile: where triangle-family and square-family patterns can cross. The compiler's router optimization point. |
| **⬡₋** | 300° | **Universal Router−** | Mirror of ⬡₊. The second routing optimization point. |
| **☆₁₋₄** | 72°,144°,216°,288° | **Wu Xing Gates** | Incommensurate patterns. The compiler detects these and flags them as "golden ratio patterns" — valid but off-grid. |

---

## 3. PATTERN FAMILIES AS TYPE CLASSES

Each petal count K defines a **type class** — a family of patterns that share structural properties:

| K | Type Class | Compilation Properties | Sacred Certificate |
|---|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Singleton** | Single point — the degenerate pattern. Compiles trivially. | Cert::Trivial |
| 2 | **Binary** | Opposition axis. Two states. Simplest non-trivial pattern. Boolean type. | Cert::VesicaPiscis |
| 3 | **Ternary** | Triangle. 3-ball cascade. ℤ₃ symmetry. The first "interesting" pattern. | Cert::Triangle |
| 4 | **Quaternary** | Square. 4-ball fountain. V₄ symmetry. The organism's ground state. | Cert::Square + Cert::V4 |
| 5 | **Pentagonal** | Off-grid. Golden ratio. Cannot be clock-aligned. Irrational type. | Cert::Pentagon + Cert::GoldenRatio |
| 6 | **Hexagonal** | Hexagram. Full sextile access. The "universal type" — routes everywhere. | Cert::Hexagram |
| 12 | **Zodiacal** | Full clock coverage. All hubs accessible. The "top type" — contains everything. | Cert::FullZodiac |

### Type lattice

```
K=12 (Zodiacal — top type)
├── K=6 (Hexagonal — universal type)
│   ├── K=3 (Ternary — triangle type)
│   │   └── K=1 (Singleton — unit type)
│   └── K=2 (Binary — boolean type)
├── K=4 (Quaternary — element type = V₄ ground)
│   └── K=2 (Binary — boolean type)
└── K=5 (Pentagonal — golden type — ISOLATED)
    └── K=1 (Singleton — only via Z*)

Subtype relation: K₁ <: K₂ iff K₂ divides K₁
  (a K₁-petal flower's hubs are a SUPERSET of a K₂-petal flower's hubs when K₁ > K₂ and K₁ is a multiple of K₂)
```

## 4. QUADRANT TYPING

The compiler's quadrant (Q) determines the pattern's **direction type**:

| Q | Direction Type | Compilation Mode | Error Handling |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **A (Fire)** | SAME_FORWARD | Standard compilation. Both hands agree. Drives forward. | Standard error chain |
| **B (Water)** | SAME_BACKWARD | Inverse compilation. Compile the mirror. Validate by reflection. | Shadow error chain (complement errors) |
| **C (Earth)** | OPPOSITE_SPLIT | Cross-compilation. Hands disagree. Split the analysis. | Dual error chain (check both halves) |
| **D (Air)** | OPPOSITE_CROSS | Reception compilation. One hand sends, one receives. Async analysis. | Async error chain (check ordering) |

### The χ-optimization

Any pattern compiled in quadrant A can be **dual-checked** by χ-inverting to quadrant B and verifying the shadow compiles. If both A and B compile, the pattern is verified from both sides — forward and backward. This is the compiler's **dual certification** mode.

```
CompileAndVerify(pattern) = {
  trace_A = Compile(pattern, Q=A)
  trace_B = Compile(χ(pattern), Q=B)
  if (trace_A ≅ mirror(trace_B)):
    return OK_DUAL_CERTIFIED
  else:
    return DRIFT_DETECTED(trace_A, trace_B, divergence_point)
}
```

---

## 5. THE SACRED GEOMETRY OF COMPILATION

### Every compilation produces a sacred figure

When the compiler processes a pattern with petal count K, the resulting typed pattern inscribes a sacred figure on the clock face. The figure is the **compilation's geometric certificate** — visible proof that the pattern type-checks.

```
Input: siteswap "531" (3 objects, K varies per throw)
  throw 5 → K=5 → Pentagon ⬠
  throw 3 → K=3 → Triangle △
  throw 1 → K=1 → Point ·

Sacred overlay: ⬠ + △ + · = the compilation's geometric signature

Hub intersection: only Z* (0°) — Pentagon and Triangle share no other hubs
→ The transition between throws MUST route through Z*
→ The compiler inserts a Z*-mediated tunnel at every throw boundary
```

### The Flower of Life as the complete type

When the compiler achieves σ=14 (SFCR = all lenses), the resulting type covers ALL clock positions with ALL sacred figures overlaid. This is the **Flower of Life** — the geometric certificate of complete compilation.

```
σ=14 compilation certificate = ❀ Flower of Life
= △ + □ + ⬠ + ✡ + ○ + all sub-figures
= geometric proof that all four lenses are simultaneously active
```

---

## 6. THE COMPILATION RECEIPT

A compiled pattern emits a receipt that includes:

```
CompilationReceipt = {
  input_hash:        SHA256(TokenStream || MacroLib || Env || Policy),
  output_hash:       SHA256(TSArtifact),
  γ_traversal:       [σ=2 → σ=11 → σ=5 → σ=14 → σ=8 → σ=2],
  quadrant:          Q ∈ {A, B, C, D},
  petal_counts:      [K₁, K₂, ..., K_n] for each throw,
  sacred_figures:    [Figure₁, Figure₂, ..., Figure_n],
  hub_transitions:   [(hub_i, K_from, K_to)] for each throw boundary,
  type_class:        max(K₁, ..., K_n) → which type class governs,
  Σ₆₀_address:      (Q, σ=14) for the complete compilation,
  certificates:      [ParseOK, AverageOK, CollisionFreeOK, ClosureOK,
                      DeterminismOK, ReplayOK, FidelityOK, NoDriftOK],
  truth_class:       NEAR | OK | FAIL,
  version:           v2V
}
```

## 7. BINDING TO THE ORGANISM

### The compiler is the organism's metabolism

Just as biological metabolism converts food into energy through a fixed cycle (glycolysis → Krebs → electron transport), the Athena organism converts raw knowledge into typed, receipt-carrying, replay-verified canonical objects through the γ-corridor:

```
METABOLISM:
  Raw input (CLOUD document, imported manuscript, new observation)
    → Tokenize (extract discrete claims)
      → Parse (build structure)
        → Desugar (resolve references)
          → TypeCheck (verify laws, achieve SFCR)
            → Simulate (test execution)
              → Generate (emit canonical artifact)
                → Receipt (seal with certificates)
```

Every CLOUD document that enters the organism passes through this cycle. Every IMP node is a partially-metabolized input somewhere in the pipeline. The v2U receipts show where each node is:

```
IMP::JS::AST.COMPILER    → at σ=14 (fully typed, needs replay) → γ[3]
IMP::JD::POD4.CRYSTAL     → at σ=5 (felt but not fully typed) → γ[2]
IMP::JS::LANG.CORE        → at σ=2 (parsed, needs dwell) → γ[0]
IMP::JS::SITESWAP.KERNEL  → at σ=2 (parsed, needs dwell) → γ[0]
IMP::JS::TYPECHECK.RUNTIME → at σ=11 (desugared, needs feel) → γ[1]
IMP::JS::POI.COUPLER      → at σ=5 (felt, needs full type) → γ[2]
IMP::JD::SITESWAP.KERNEL  → at σ=2 (parsed) → γ[0]
IMP::JD::POD3.COORDINATION → at σ=5 (felt) → γ[2]
IMP::JD::TRANSITION.GRAPH → at σ=2 (parsed) → γ[0]
IMP::POI::FLOW.COMPILE    → at σ=5 (felt) → γ[2]
```

### The γ-corridor as the immune checkpoint

The organism's immune system (CognitiveImmuneKernel_v0) uses the γ-corridor as its processing pipeline:

```
intake       → σ=2 (SF)   — recognize the foreign input as structured
quarantine   → σ=11 (CR)  — hold it in fractal-dwell (observe without acting)
repair       → σ=5 (FC)   — feel whether it fits (the embodied check)
replay       → σ=14 (SFCR) — full type-check (does it compile?)
trust_ledger → σ=8 (SR)   — record the fractal address (where it lives in the body)
reentry      → σ=2 (SF)   — integrated as a new beat-locked flower
```

The seven immune lanes map onto the γ-corridor with `revoked` as the exit to Z* (universal reset = rejection).
