# Active Nervous System

This folder turns `DEEPER_CRYSTALIZATION` into an addressable manuscript brain instead of a loose pile of `.docx` files.

## What is here

- `00_RECEIPTS`: live-docs gate status and build receipts.
- `01_TOOLKIT`: normalized prompt contracts and drafting rules.
- `02_CORPUS_CAPSULES`: one markdown capsule per source record from the local atlas.
- `03_METRO`: the current metro maps, agent grid, and queue.
- `04_CHAPTERS`: the 21-station chapter scaffold.
- `05_APPENDICES`: the 16-hub appendix scaffold.
- `06_RUNTIME`: rebuild and regeneration notes.
- `07_RECURSION`: recursive depth lattice, frontier queue, and loop protocol.
- `08_MIRROR_CORPUS`: local mirror intake from Memory Docs and extracted manuscript text.
- `09_CIVILIZATION`: sign governance, hierarchy, message/task protocol, and civilization-scale recursion maps.
- `10_FRONTIERS`: high-yield evidence bundles plus drafting-prep packs for the weakest chapters.
- `11_SHADOWS`: blind-spot and limitation reports used to steer the next recursion pass.
- `12_SYNTHESIS`: canonical chapter-to-appendix deep synthesis, lens field, symmetry stack, and four metro resolutions. Manifest: `06_RUNTIME/11_deep_synthesis_manifest.json`.
- `13_DEEPER_NEURAL_NET`: four-element document-pair neural field, 16x16 gate matrix, query indices, CLI query surface, and Appendix Q network. Manifest: `13_DEEPER_NEURAL_NET/09_RUNTIME/00_network_manifest.json`.
- `14_PARALLEL_PLANS`: materialized `4^4` frontier plan lattice for `Ch03`, `Ch10`, `Ch12`, and `Ch14`, including execution tiers and dependency routes. Manifest: `14_PARALLEL_PLANS/04_plan_manifest.json`.

## Current state

- Source records indexed from this folder: `{record_count}`
- Source layers merged: `LocalProject + MemoryDocs + FreshExtracted + MythMath`
- Live Google Docs preflight: `{"BLOCKED" if live_docs_blocked else "PASS"}`
- Canonical scaffold: `21 chapters + 16 appendices + source capsules + metro maps + civilization governance stack + deep synthesis + deeper neural net + queryable local neural routing + chapter frontier compiler + 4^4 parallel frontier plan lattice`

# Internal Prompt Toolkit

This toolkit is the normalized operating contract extracted from the prompt pack, the local prompt manuscript, and the live manuscript routing materials.

## Hard rules

- Always attempt live Google Docs search before drafting the next manuscript section.
- If live Docs are blocked, record the blocker and continue with the strongest local mirrors.
- Draft only the requested section unless an explicit expansion task is being executed.
- Treat the input section as a suggestion, not a ceiling.
- Keep every output addressable, metro-routable, and replay-safe.
- Prefer abstention over fabrication when the evidence class is ambiguous.

## Section pass contract

- Output final-draft prose only for accepted section passes.
- Preserve the chapter or appendix name at the end of the section for internal routing.
- Improve sequencing, theorem order, algorithm order, and witness structure when stronger synthesis is available.
- Keep the master manuscript synchronized after accepted section updates.

## Tome pass contract

- Maintain a 21-chapter crystal and a 16-appendix routing shell.
- Use the chapter station header `[Arc a | Rot r | Lane n | w=k]` for every chapter surface.
- Maintain the deterministic router basis: parse, arc, lens, facet, truth overlay, corridor, replay, target.
- Keep appendices as routing hubs rather than loose supplement files.

## Chapter 11 contract

- Compile Desire, Question, and Improvement as explicit operators.
- Test witness closure before claiming a stable delta.
- Invoke Void only when inherited structure blocks gain more than it preserves lawful continuity.
- Preserve the restart token when collapsing stale scaffolds.
"""

# Section Drafting and Intake Rules

## Live-docs preflight

- Status at build time: `{live_docs_status}`
- Required path for live search: `C:\\Users\\dmitr\\Documents\\Athena Agent\\Trading Bot\\docs_search.py`
- Required OAuth material: `Trading Bot\\credentials.json` and `Trading Bot\\token.json`

## Local fallback order

1. `Trading Bot\\Memory Docs`
2. `MATH\\FINAL FORM\\MYTH - MATH`
3. `FRESH\\_extracted`
4. The fresh atlas for `DEEPER_CRYSTALIZATION`
5. Existing `self_actualize` manuscript packets and metro surfaces
6. Local source capsules in `02_CORPUS_CAPSULES`
7. Accepted chapter and appendix scaffolds in this nervous system

## Evidence rules

- Use direct source capsules first.
- Route every new section through its chapter file and appendix hubs.
- Record blockers in receipts rather than hiding them in prose.
- Keep all future final-draft sections mirrored into markdown, not only `.docx`.
"""
    operating = """
# Nervous System Operating Loop

## Wave 1: intake

- Re-run the local atlas when source files change.
- Re-run the live-docs gate before new section drafting.
- Refresh source capsules if new `.docx` material lands in the project root.

## Wave 2: routing

- Route source capsules into chapter surfaces.
- Route chapter surfaces through appendix hubs.
- Refresh metro maps and the parallel agent grid after structural changes.

## Wave 3: drafting

- Draft only the active chapter or appendix section.
- Write deltas into chapter files first, then merge accepted material into the master manuscript.
- Preserve witness and replay notes in receipts or runtime files, not inside final-draft prose.

## Wave 4: contraction

- Update the build queue.
- Mark which chapter nodes gained evidence.
- Record the next highest-yield unresolved gate.

## Rebuild order

1. Refresh `_build/atlas/deeper_crystalization_atlas.json`.
2. Refresh `_build/receipts/live_docs_gate_status.md`.
3. Refresh `_build/atlas/myth_math_atlas.json`.
4. Run `ns_builder.py`.
5. Draft the next accepted section inside the matching chapter or appendix file.
6. Promote accepted markdown into the master manuscript after witness review.
