# CONTINUOUS-DISCRETE CORRESPONDENCE

## 1. Continuous Foundations

Definition 1.1 (Manifold).
A topological manifold M is a second-countable Hausdorff space where each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of R^n.

Definition 1.2 (Chart).
A chart is a pair (U, phi) with phi: U -> R^n a homeomorphism.

Definition 1.3 (Smooth Structure).
A smooth structure is a maximal atlas of C-infinity compatible charts.

Definition 1.4 (Riemannian Metric).
A Riemannian metric g assigns an inner product to each tangent space T_p M.

## 2. Function Spaces

Definition 2.1 (Lp Spaces).
Lp(X, mu) is the space of measurable f with integral |f|^p finite.

Definition 2.2 (Sobolev Spaces).
W^{k,p}(Omega) includes functions with weak derivatives up to order k in Lp.

Definition 2.3 (Trace Operators).
A trace operator gamma maps H^1(Omega) to boundary values when Omega has Lipschitz boundary.

## 3. Discrete Foundations

Definition 3.1 (Graph).
A graph G = (V, E) with adjacency operator A and Laplacian L.

Definition 3.2 (Discrete Operator).
Discrete operators act on functions f: V -> R using adjacency, incidence, or Laplacian matrices.

## 4. Correspondence Principle

Principle 4.1 (Harmonic Correspondence).
Continuous operators on M correspond to discrete operators on a graph approximation of M with bounded error under refinement.

## 5. Hybrid Equations

Definition 5.1 (Hybrid Equation).
A hybrid equation couples a continuous operator with a discrete operator by a bridging term B:
- L_c u + B(u, v) = 0
- L_d v + B(v, u) = 0

Definition 5.2 (Convergence).
As graph resolution increases, the discrete solution converges to the continuous solution when B is stable and bounded.

## 6. Operational Use

- Use continuous models for global invariants and smooth optimization.
- Use discrete models for constraints, combinatorics, and routing.
- Use hybrid equations to transfer structure across representations.

## 7. Status
This correspondence is the mathematical bridge between continuous and discrete subsystems.
