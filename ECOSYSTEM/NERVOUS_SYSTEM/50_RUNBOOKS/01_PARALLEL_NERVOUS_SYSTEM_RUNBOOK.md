# PARALLEL NERVOUS SYSTEM RUNBOOK

## 1. Purpose

This runbook defines how to use the nervous system for the next full-corpus synthesis pass.

## 2. Standard Run Order

1. check live Docs gate,
2. choose task seed,
3. choose primary regions,
4. choose primary metro line,
5. decide tandem broadcast shape,
6. compile 64-worker crystal,
7. emit worker packets,
8. contract to archetypes,
9. contract to regions,
10. emit final synthesis packet,
11. record witness and unresolved ambiguities.

## 3. Recommended First Full Run

Task:

- build a whole-project interconnect map that links `MATH`, `Voynich`, `NERUAL NETWORK`,
  `self_actualize`, `Trading Bot`, and `ECOSYSTEM`.

Primary regions:

- `R1`, `R3`, `R4`, `R5`, `R6`, `R8`

Primary lines:

- `Line A`, `Line C`, `Line D`, `Line E`

Contraction target:

- one canonical nervous-system synthesis packet plus one upgrade queue.

## 4. Deliverables

- region packet set,
- metro-line packet set,
- promoted neuron list,
- synapse ledger,
- final active-frontier update.

## 5. Tandem Broadcast Rule

When many agents receive the same high-level prompt:

1. the kernel assigns shard boundaries first,
2. every worker uses the same packet schema,
3. every worker names its contraction target,
4. no worker emits a final whole-corpus verdict alone,
5. the kernel emits the continuation self prompt at the end of the wave.
