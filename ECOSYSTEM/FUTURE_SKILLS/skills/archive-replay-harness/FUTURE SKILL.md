# archive-replay-harness

## address
1321

## priority
P1

## lane
formal-framework

## description
Replay extracted or archive-backed framework artifacts against declared checks so archive promotion becomes test-bearing.

## triggers
- archive replay harness
- verify this
- audit this
- check whether this is ready

## inputs
- framework source paths
- kernel references
- archive or live tree

## outputs
- evaluation artifact
- measured results
- follow-up recommendations

## procedure
1. Inspect the current artifact or gateway state.
2. Compare it against the required invariants and expected outputs.
3. Record blockers, partial closure, or passing conditions explicitly.
4. Emit a verification receipt and the next lawful action.

## validation
- results are measured against a named surface
- failures remain inspectable after the run

## failure modes
- If prerequisites are missing, emit a blocked receipt with exact missing pieces.
- If evidence is partial, classify the result as partial instead of complete.

## references
- `C:\Users\dmitr\Documents\Athena Agent\self_actualize\archive_manifest.json`
- `C:\Users\dmitr\Documents\Athena Agent\NERUAL NETWORK\TEST SUITES\ultimate_bench.py`

## rationale
Archive visibility is not enough without replay and benchmark closure.
