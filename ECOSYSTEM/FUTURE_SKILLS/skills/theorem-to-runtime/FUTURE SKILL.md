# theorem-to-runtime

## address
1210

## priority
P0

## lane
formal-framework

## description
Compile stable formal objects into tested runtime modules, schemas, or executable kernels with explicit theorem lineage.

## triggers
- theorem to runtime
- compile this
- turn this into an artifact
- materialize the output

## inputs
- framework source paths
- kernel references
- archive or live tree

## outputs
- witness-bearing artifact
- source linkage
- replay note

## procedure
1. Select the strongest witnessed inputs for the target artifact.
2. Transform the inputs into the requested executable or publishable surface.
3. Record assumptions and surviving residuals.
4. Emit the compiled artifact with its lineage and replay recipe.

## validation
- artifact cites real source paths or live-memory provenance
- lineage is preserved without silent rewrite

## failure modes
- If the inputs are under-specified, emit a partial artifact and open residuals.
- If the output drifts from the source intent, preserve both views and flag the gap.

## rationale
The theory layer is richer than the executable bridge layer.
