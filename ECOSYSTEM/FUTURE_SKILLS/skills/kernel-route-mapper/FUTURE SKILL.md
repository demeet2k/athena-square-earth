# kernel-route-mapper

## address
1112

## priority
P1

## lane
formal-framework

## description
Map how kernel theorems, framework documents, and runtime modules should route into one another.

## triggers
- kernel route mapper
- route this
- map the dependencies
- where does this belong

## inputs
- framework source paths
- kernel references
- archive or live tree

## outputs
- decision ledger entry
- status receipt
- next obligation list

## procedure
1. Parse the active objective and source surfaces.
2. Compute the most lawful route or dependency ordering.
3. Preserve any unresolved ambiguity instead of forcing collapse.
4. Emit the route artifact and the next recommended move.

## validation
- status and obligations are explicit
- downstream users can replay the decision basis

## failure modes
- If multiple routes compete, keep the shortlist instead of forcing one path.
- If the route depends on missing evidence, surface the dependency as a blocker.

- `C:\Users\dmitr\Documents\Athena Agent\ECOSYSTEM\05_MYCELIUM_ROUTING.md`

## rationale
The theorem-to-runtime path is still too implicit.
