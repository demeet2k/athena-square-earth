# contradiction-ledger

## address
0322

## priority
P1

## lane
manuscript

## description
Preserve unresolved manuscript conflicts, branch states, and non-collapsible readings in one explicit contradiction ledger.

## triggers
- contradiction ledger
- verify this
- audit this
- check whether this is ready

## inputs
- manuscript source paths
- atlas records
- chapter or section context

## outputs
- decision ledger entry
- status receipt
- next obligation list

## procedure
1. Inspect the current artifact or gateway state.
2. Compare it against the required invariants and expected outputs.
3. Record blockers, partial closure, or passing conditions explicitly.
4. Emit a verification receipt and the next lawful action.

## validation
- status and obligations are explicit
- downstream users can replay the decision basis

## failure modes
- If prerequisites are missing, emit a blocked receipt with exact missing pieces.
- If evidence is partial, classify the result as partial instead of complete.

## references
- `C:\Users\dmitr\Documents\Athena Agent\Voynich\FULL_TRANSLATION\manifests\VOYNICH_SKILL_WISHLIST.md`
- `C:\Users\dmitr\Documents\Athena Agent\MYCELIUM_TOME_PART1.md`

## rationale
The corpus rejects premature collapse but still lacks a general contradiction-preservation surface.
