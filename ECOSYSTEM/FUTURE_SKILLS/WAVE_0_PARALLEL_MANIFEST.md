# WAVE 0 PARALLEL MANIFEST

run_id: FUTURE-SKILL-WAVE-0
objective: Instantiate the first executable frontier of future skills from the 256x256 Athena skill lattice.
wave_index: 0
truth_class: OK for local incubation, BLOCKED for live Docs retrieval until OAuth is configured

## Stop Conditions

- Stop when every frontier skill has a scaffold and lawful references.
- Stop early for live-memory execution if `credentials.json` and `token.json` are still missing.
- Expand Wave 1 only after a subset of Wave 0 skills reach stable `OK` or `NEAR`.
