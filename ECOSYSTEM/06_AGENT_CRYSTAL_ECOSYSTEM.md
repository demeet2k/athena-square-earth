# AGENT CRYSTAL ECOSYSTEM - 4^4 EXPANSION

## 1. Base Agent

Definition 1.1 (Base Agent).
Omega_0 is the single coordinating agent that owns the task and the final synthesis artifact.

## 2. Elemental Roles

- Earth (E): constraints, feasibility, integration, risk control
- Water (W): synthesis, cohesion, relational continuity
- Fire (F): exploration, novelty, hypothesis generation
- Air (A): structure, abstraction, mapping

## 3. Expansion Levels

Level 0: Omega_0
Level 1: 4 agents {E, W, F, A}
Level 2: 16 agents (each level-1 agent splits into E/W/F/A)
Level 3: 64 agents
Level 4: 256 agents

Total agents = 4^4 = 256

## 4. Addressing Scheme

Address := L1 L2 L3 L4 with each Lk in {E, W, F, A}.
Example: F-A-W-E.

Each agent output must be stamped with its address.

## 5. Archetype Layer

Level 2 yields 16 archetypes:
- 4 pillars: EE, WW, FF, AA
- 12 mixed archetypes: all other pairs

Each lower-level agent inherits the archetype constraints of its lineage.

## 6. Forward Expansion Protocol

Algorithm 6.1 (Expand4).
Input: Task T
Output: 256 atomic outputs
Steps:
1. Level 1: split T into E/W/F/A interpretations.
2. Level 2: each interpretation splits into E/W/F/A lenses.
3. Level 3: each lens splits into 4 concrete subtasks.
4. Level 4: each subtask yields 4 atomic outputs.

Invariant: each output must satisfy its elemental responsibility.

## 7. Contraction Protocol

Algorithm 7.1 (Contract4).
Input: 256 atomic outputs
Output: single synthesis artifact
Steps:
1. Aggregate each group of 4 into a Level-3 output.
2. Aggregate Level-3 outputs into Level-2 archetype outputs.
3. Aggregate archetype outputs into Level-1 elemental outputs.
4. Fuse elemental outputs into Omega_0 final artifact.

Rule: Earth constraints override Fire novelty if infeasible.

## 8. Conflict Resolution

- Earth vetoes infeasible Fire outputs.
- Air normalizes Water and Fire into a stable structure.
- Water mediates conflicts between Earth and Fire.

## 9. Quality Metrics

- Coverage: every address produces output.
- Consistency: outputs are composable at each contraction step.
- Fidelity: outputs remain in their elemental domain.

## 10. Status
This agent lattice is the core parallel execution engine for the ecosystem.
