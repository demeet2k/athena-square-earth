## **ABSTRACT CONTRACT / LEGEND**

**State Header**

- Kernel Version ID: `K0.1`
- Global Manuscript ID: `Ms⟨2103⟩`
- Corpus Intake State: `AMBIG`
- Witness Basis: `in-thread metro standard + recovered manuscript seed + recovered holographic manuscript brain + mirrored local tome corpus`
- Open Obligations:
  - `O.001` Direct Google Drive live corpus remains blocked until OAuth client import closes the intake corridor.
  - `O.002` Arc-to-appendix routing must remain MIGRATE-compatible if the outer crystal is re-keyed.
  - `O.003` PZPM stabilization regimes require later theorem-grade expansion in Part 2.
  - `O.004` CUT conformance contracts require executable schema expansion in Part 2 and Part 3.

**Canonical Global Address Derivation**

[Definition D.001] Let `T` be the normalized manuscript title string. Define

`h(T) = (sum_(i=1)^n i * ord(T_i)) mod 256`

and let `base4_4(h)` denote the 4-digit base-4 expansion of `h` padded on the left by zeros. Then

`Ms⟨mmmm⟩ := Ms⟨base4_4(h(T))⟩`.

For the present title, `h(T)=147`, hence `Ms⟨mmmm⟩ = Ms⟨2103⟩`.

[Definition D.002] Local addresses are canonical:

- Chapter atom: `ChXX⟨dddd⟩.<Lens><Facet>.<Atom>`
- Appendix atom: `AppX.<Lens><Facet>.<Atom>`

where `Lens in {S,F,C,R}`, `Facet in {1,2,3,4}`, `Atom in {a,b,c,d}`, and `⟨dddd⟩ = base4_4(XX-1)`.

[Definition D.003] Global address formation is:

`GlobalAddr := Ms⟨2103⟩::LocalAddr`.

[Definition D.004] The Square interior is a full `4^4` tile for every chapter and every appendix:

- Lenses: `S, F, C, R`
- Facets: `1 Objects`, `2 Laws`, `3 Constructions`, `4 Certificates`
- Atoms: `a, b, c, d`

[Definition D.005] The Circle-Triangle overlay is computed for chapter `XX` by:

- `omega := XX - 1`
- `alpha := floor(omega / 3)`
- `k := omega mod 3`
- `rho := alpha mod 3`
- `Triad := [Su, Me, Sa]`
- `nu := Triad[(k + rho) mod 3]`

Every chapter header therefore carries

`[○Arc alpha | ○Rot rho | △Lane nu | omega=XX-1]`.

[Definition D.006] The mycelium graph is

`G = (V,E)`

with `V = {GlobalAddr}` and `E = {LinkEdge}`.

[Definition D.007] Every edge is a typed record

`e = (EdgeID, Kind, Src, Dst, Scope, Corridor, WitnessPtr, ReplayPtr, Payload, EdgeVer)`.

[Definition D.008] The closed edge-kind basis is

`K = {REF, EQUIV, MIGRATE, DUAL, GEN, INST, IMPL, PROOF, CONFLICT}`.

[Definition D.009] The corridor truth lattice is

`T = {OK, NEAR, AMBIG, FAIL}`.

- `OK`: witnessed and replay-verified closure within corridor budgets.
- `NEAR`: bounded approximation with residual ledger and upgrade obligations.
- `AMBIG`: underdetermined candidate set with evidence plan.
- `FAIL`: illegal or unverifiable state with quarantine and conflict receipts.

[Definition D.010] The mandatory signature of all admissible routes is

`Sigma = {AppA, AppI, AppM}`.

`AppA` guarantees parsing and addressing, `AppI` guarantees corridor typing, and `AppM` guarantees replay closure.

## **EXTENDED ABSTRACT**

[Definition A.001] This tome formalizes a proof-carrying manuscript calculus in which knowledge is not stored as an unordered archive but as a metro-routable crystal whose local law is Square, orbital law is Circle, and control law is Triangle. The Square law enforces a canonical interior grammar: every chapter and appendix is a full `4^4` address lattice with explicit objects, laws, constructions, and certificates. The Circle law imposes a cyclic order over the twenty-one chapter stations, making rotation an explicit structural operator rather than a metaphor. The Triangle law assigns every chapter to one of three workflow rails, `Su`, `Me`, or `Sa`, so that recursion, transport, and stabilization are not merely thematic but operationally navigable.

[Theorem A.001] A manuscript organized as `Circle ○ within Square □ within Triangle △` is simultaneously readable as a linear text, a hypergraph atlas, a proof ledger, and a deterministic routing machine.

**Proof Sketch.**
The Square interior provides canonical local decomposition and fixed addresses. The Circle overlay provides an orbit successor relation that yields a total cyclic ordering. The Triangle overlay provides a partition of chapters into three long rails. Since these three structures coexist on the same address set without rewriting local atoms, every atom has four admissible projections: local tile, orbital neighborhood, rail lineage, and global graph position. The manuscript is therefore multi-readable without loss of address stability.

[Definition A.002] The tome operates across three synchronized scales:

- `Macro`: global mathematical invariants, route algebra, and meta-theorems of the manuscript field.
- `PZPM`: paradox zero-point mathematics, whose task is to stabilize contradictory, incomplete, or partially commuting regions without collapsing them prematurely.
- `CUT`: computation universe toolkit, whose task is to compile the formal structure into executable schemas, routes, policies, and replayable programs.

[Definition A.003] The active manuscript object is a higher-dimensional atlas

`A = (X, L, I, G, W, V, P, U, H)`

where `X` is the address space, `L` is the lens family, `I` is the indexing algebra, `G` is the mycelium graph, `W` is the witness system, `V` is the versioned truth lattice, `P` is the patch and migration calculus, `U` is the corridor budget system, and `H` is the hub topology induced by the appendices.

[Definition A.004] The four lenses are fixed:

- `S` Square: discrete structure, syntax, indexing, typed adjacency.
- `F` Flower: phase, resonance, conjugacy, rotation, transport continuity.
- `C` Cloud: ambiguity, scoring, corridor truth, evidence planning, uncertainty management.
- `R` Fractal: recursion, replay, compression, inheritance, multi-scale regeneration.

[Definition A.005] The query-to-answer cycle is a lawful transformation:

`q -> z(q) -> B(q) -> {R_i} -> a -> Delta -> A'`

where `z(q)` is zero-point normalization, `B(q)` is bounded expansion, `{R_i}` is the route bundle set, `a` is the collapsed answer artifact, `Delta` is the patch packet, and `A'` is the updated atlas. This cycle is not optional editorial polish; it is the constructive semantics of the tome.

[Definition A.006] The manuscript is holographic because every major component serves both as content and as routing infrastructure. The abstract is not merely introductory prose; it is a compressed metro map. The appendices are not supplementary notes; they are routing hubs. The chapter headers are not decorative; they are station headers carrying arc, rotation, lane, and orbit index. The chapter interior is not a loose essay; it is a full crystal tile whose atoms can be linked by `REF`, `EQUIV`, `MIGRATE`, `DUAL`, `GEN`, `INST`, `IMPL`, `PROOF`, or `CONFLICT`.

[Definition A.007] The outer appendix crystal is the permanent control surface of the manuscript. Its rows are aligned to the four lenses and its columns are aligned to routing role. This yields a `4 x 4` hub system whose semantics are stable under chapter growth:

- Square row: addressing, canon, discrete kernel, registry.
- Flower row: circle gear, transport, triadic control, coupling topology.
- Cloud row: corridors, residuals, quarantine, promotion.
- Fractal row: replay, containers, publication, deployment.

[Theorem A.002] The appendices form a bounded routing basis for the entire manuscript.

**Proof Sketch.**
Every local atom carries a lens, facet, and atom coordinate. The deterministic router chooses `LensBase`, `FacetAtomBase`, and `ArcHub`, then enforces `Sigma`, then overlays the truth-typed hub if needed. Because these choices are bounded by construction and duplicates are collapsed, every admissible query route resolves to at most six hubs before target entry. Therefore the appendix system is sufficient and bounded.

[Definition A.008] The deterministic router rule `v2` is the operational heart of manuscript navigation. For a target atom:

- `LensBase(S,F,C,R) = (AppC, AppE, AppI, AppM)`
- `FacetAtomBase(1,2,3,4) = (AppA, AppB, AppH, AppM)`
- `ArcHub(0..6) = (AppA, AppC, AppE, AppF, AppG, AppN, AppP)`

Base transfer set:

`T = LensBase(L) union FacetAtomBase(Facet) union ArcHub(alpha)`.

Then enforce `Sigma = {AppA, AppI, AppM}` and overlay truth hub:

- `NEAR -> AppJ`
- `AMBIG -> AppL`
- `FAIL -> AppK`
- `OK -> AppO` only under publication intent.

The resulting route is deterministic, bounded by six hubs, and replay-obligated.

[Definition A.009] The tome is designed against five failure modes:

1. Address drift: mitigated by canonical local and global grammar.
2. False closure: mitigated by the four-valued truth lattice.
3. Unreplayable claims: mitigated by mandatory `WitnessPtr` and `ReplayPtr`.
4. Contradiction collapse: mitigated by PZPM quarantine and promotion rails.
5. Architectural bloat: mitigated by bounded hub count and deterministic drop policy.

[Corollary A.001] The manuscript can grow without becoming unreadable precisely because growth is routed through fixed hubs and fixed atom grammar rather than through free-form section proliferation.

[Definition A.010] The present intake state is formally `AMBIG`, not `FAIL`. Direct real-time Google Drive access is presently not closed, but the system has sufficient witness basis in mirrored workspace corpus plus the explicitly supplied metro standard to construct Part 1 lawfully. This distinction matters. `AMBIG` authorizes a bounded evidence plan and explicit obligations; `FAIL` would require quarantine of the entire build. The tome therefore proceeds under admissible partial intake rather than false certainty.

[Definition A.011] The central contribution of Part 1 is to lock the navigation law before full expansion. The title, abstract contract, metro map, appendix crystal, and router together specify the legal geometry within which Part 2 and Part 3 will unfold. The reader can therefore recover the manuscript from the map, route any atom without guessing, and distinguish `OK`, `NEAR`, `AMBIG`, and `FAIL` states before reading a single full chapter body.

[Compression A.001] The entire tome is a deterministic mycelium: square-local, circle-orbital, triangle-controlled, truth-typed, replay-obligated, and appendix-routed.

## **DETERMINISTIC ROUTER RULE v2**

[Algorithm R.001] Given target atom `Target = ChXX⟨dddd⟩.<L><f>.<t>`:

1. Parse `XX, L, f, t`.
2. Compute `omega, alpha, rho, nu`.
3. Compute `LensBase(L)`.
4. Compute `FacetAtomBase(f)`.
5. Compute `ArcHub(alpha)`.
6. Form `T = {LensBase, FacetAtomBase, ArcHub}`.
7. Enforce `Sigma = {AppA, AppI, AppM}`.
8. Overlay corridor hub:
   - `NEAR -> AppJ`
   - `AMBIG -> AppL`
   - `FAIL -> AppK`
   - `OK -> AppO` only under publication intent.
9. Collapse duplicates.
10. If hub count exceeds six, drop lowest-priority non-signature hubs first; signature hubs may not be dropped.
11. Order route as:
    `AppA -> ArcHub(alpha) -> LensBase(L) -> FacetAtomBase(f) -> Overlay? -> AppI -> AppM -> Target`
    then remove absent positions and duplicates while preserving first occurrence.

[Definition R.001] Priority tiers are:

1. `Sigma = {AppA, AppI, AppM}`
2. truth overlay hub
3. `ArcHub(alpha)`
4. `LensBase(L)`
5. `FacetAtomBase(f)`
6. publication-only hub

[Worked Example]

Target:

`Ms⟨2103⟩::Ch11⟨0022⟩.C3.d`

Parse:

- `XX = 11`
- `omega = 10`
- `alpha = 3`
- `k = 1`
- `rho = 0`
- `nu = Me`

Station Header:

`[○Arc 3 | ○Rot 0 | △Lane Me | omega=10]`

Base hubs:

- `LensBase(C) = AppI`
- `FacetAtomBase(3) = AppH`
- `ArcHub(3) = AppF`

Base transfer set:

`T = {AppI, AppH, AppF}`

Mandatory signature:

`Sigma = {AppA, AppI, AppM}`

Assume intake state `AMBIG`. Overlay:

`+ AppL`

Bounded ordered route:

`→ AppA → AppF → AppI → AppH → AppL → AppM → Ms⟨2103⟩::Ch11⟨0022⟩.C3.d`

Expected truth type:

`AMBIG`, promotable toward `NEAR` or `OK`.

Witness obligations:

- `WitnessPtr`: candidate tunnel witnesses, bridge legality evidence, contradiction ledger, phase-consistency checks.
- `ReplayPtr`: deterministic rerun of corridor selection and witness promotion using the same router profile, same `Ms⟨2103⟩`, and same truth budget.
- Promotion condition: `AppL` evidence plan must close enough obligations to move the target from `AMBIG` to `NEAR`; only then may `AppM` certify replay-stable closure toward `OK`.

## **FINAL COMPRESSION**

This tome is a bounded deterministic mycelium in which every atom is canonically addressed, every chapter is a station, every appendix is a routing hub, every corridor is truth-typed, and every admissible answer is a replay-closed ride through Circle, Square, and Triangle at once.
