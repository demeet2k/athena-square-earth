# Grand Central Weight Exchange

Date: `2026-03-12`
Generated: `2026-03-12T19:09:36.577589+00:00`
Docs gate: `BLOCKED`
Verdict: `OK`

This ledger defines the unified internal weight vector for Grand Central Station.

## Weight Fields

- `salience`: how much corpus mass or strategic centrality the route carries
- `proof`: how much witness-bearing authority the route currently owns
- `freshness`: how alive and current the route is in the runtime organism
- `cost`: how expensive the route is to maintain or metabolize
- `continuity`: how well the route preserves lawful carry-through across changes
- `confidence`: confidence floor derived from proof and freshness together
- `replay_value`: how well the route closes through replay, receipt, and rerun

## Dispatch Law

`dispatch = 2.5*salience + 2*proof + 1.5*freshness + 1.25*continuity + 1.5*confidence + 1.5*replay - 1.5*cost`

## Thresholds

- promotion threshold: `6.35`
- live interchange threshold: `7.0`
- soft demotion threshold: `5.4`
- route baseline freshness: `0.81`

## Promotion Law

- routes above the promotion threshold may claim live interchange attention
- routes above the live interchange threshold are first-wave station priorities
- routes below the soft demotion threshold stay readable, but should not outrank fresher corridors
