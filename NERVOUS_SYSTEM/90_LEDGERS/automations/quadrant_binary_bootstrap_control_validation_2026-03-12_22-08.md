# Quadrant Binary Bootstrap Control Validation

- validation timestamp: 2026-03-12 22:08 -07:00
- plan: QBD Bootstrap Persistence Isolation

## implementation status
implemented.

- `quadrant-binary-weave-probe` was paused in both [automation.toml](C:/Users/dmitr/.codex/automations/quadrant-binary-weave-probe/automation.toml) and the scheduler DB.
- `quadrant-binary-weave` was left unchanged and remains active at [automation.toml](C:/Users/dmitr/.codex/automations/quadrant-binary-weave/automation.toml).
- `quadrant-binary-bootstrap-control` was added at [automation.toml](C:/Users/dmitr/.codex/automations/quadrant-binary-bootstrap-control/automation.toml) with hourly cadence and root cwd `C:/Users/dmitr/Documents/Athena Agent`.

## static checks
passed.

- control TOML parses and is ASCII-only.
- probe TOML is `PAUSED`.
- production TOML was not modified in this pass.
- control report sink does not collide with probe or production report names.
- probe memory remains pinned to `bootstrap`.

## runtime control result
partial success.

Control lane:
- automation id: `quadrant-binary-bootstrap-control`
- run thread id: `019ce590-01f4-77c3-8321-9ff550d40c88`
- run status: `PENDING_REVIEW`

Observed artifacts:
- parent thread row: present in `C:\Users\dmitr\.codex\state_5.sqlite`
- rollout file: present at `C:\Users\dmitr\.codex\sessions\2026\03\12\rollout-2026-03-12T21-59-06-019ce590-01f4-77c3-8321-9ff550d40c88.jsonl`
- control report: present at [quadrant_binary_bootstrap_control_2026-03-12_22.md](C:/Users/dmitr/Documents/Athena%20Agent/NERVOUS_SYSTEM/90_LEDGERS/automations/quadrant_binary_bootstrap_control_2026-03-12_22.md)
- inbox item: not present in `C:\Users\dmitr\.codex\sqlite\codex-dev.db` (`inbox_items` count remains `0`)

Control report content check:
- `control phase`: present
- `docs gate status`: present and honest
- `qbd path witness`: present
- `anchors checked`: present and reports none
- `raw source status`: present and reports not inspected
- `artifact status`: present
- `blockers`: present
- `restart seed`: present

Docs gate witness from control report:
- `BLOCKED`
- missing:
  - `C:\Users\dmitr\Documents\Athena Agent\Trading Bot\credentials.json`
  - `C:\Users\dmitr\Documents\Athena Agent\Trading Bot\token.json`

## differential result
root-cwd control crossed persistence surfaces that the QBD child-cwd lanes did not.

Control lane succeeded on:
- parent thread persistence
- rollout file persistence
- control report writeback
- transition to `PENDING_REVIEW`

QBD child-cwd lanes still failed on those same surfaces:
- probe run `019ce57f-6967-7d41-b821-5d6a97d40366`: no parent thread row, no rollout file, no probe report, still historical `IN_PROGRESS`
- production run `019ce581-399f-7dc0-a12f-cc3c431842fb`: no parent thread row, no rollout file, no QBD report, still `IN_PROGRESS`

Probe freeze check:
- no new probe run was created after pause
- scheduler row for `quadrant-binary-weave-probe` now has `status = PAUSED` and `next_run_at = NULL`

## interpretation
the main defect is no longer best explained as a corpus-content or generic bootstrap failure.

The strongest current localization is:
- primary boundary: `Quadrant Binary` child-cwd or worktree materialization path
- secondary unresolved defect: inbox artifact creation is absent even for the successful root-cwd control run

This means the control lane achieved the intended isolation outcome:
- parent-side persistence is possible under root cwd
- the missing parent persistence on QBD-root lanes is specific to that narrower execution path

## failure classes after this pass
- `QBD child-cwd persistence failure`: still active
- `No inbox item`: still active, including for the control lane
- `Docs gate blocked`: active but honest, and not the cause of the persistence split

## regression / coexistence notes
- [quadrant-binary-weave automation.toml](C:/Users/dmitr/.codex/automations/quadrant-binary-weave/automation.toml) remained unchanged in this pass.
- [quadrant-binary-weave-probe automation.toml](C:/Users/dmitr/.codex/automations/quadrant-binary-weave-probe/automation.toml) is paused, not deleted.
- [quadrant-binary-bootstrap-control automation.toml](C:/Users/dmitr/.codex/automations/quadrant-binary-bootstrap-control/automation.toml) is the only new lane added.
- [corpus-weave-2 automation.toml](C:/Users/dmitr/.codex/automations/corpus-weave-2/automation.toml) was not modified in this pass. Its current paused state predates this implementation.
