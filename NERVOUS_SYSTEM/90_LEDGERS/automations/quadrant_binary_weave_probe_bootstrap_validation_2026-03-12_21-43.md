# Quadrant Binary Weave Probe Bootstrap Validation

Timestamp: 2026-03-12 21:43 -07:00

## Summary
The temporary probe lane `quadrant-binary-weave-probe` was added and registered successfully. Its first run executed the `bootstrap` phase only and was used to isolate whether the remaining QBD stall happens before or after corpus-specific work begins.

## Static Checks
- Probe TOML parses cleanly.
- Probe TOML contains zero non-ASCII characters.
- Probe memory contains zero non-ASCII characters.
- Probe report path does not collide with production or prior validation files.
- Production `quadrant-binary-weave` lane was left unchanged during this pass.
- `corpus-weave-2` was not modified during this pass.

## Probe Lane Identity
- automation id: `quadrant-binary-weave-probe`
- current phase: `bootstrap`
- probe run id: `019ce57f-6967-7d41-b821-5d6a97d40366`
- probe child thread id: `019ce57f-6a8c-78b1-9e7a-fcf68ba4691b`

## Probe Bootstrap Result
Status: FAILED

Observed behavior:
- scheduler created the probe run row
- probe run remained `IN_PROGRESS`
- no inbox item was created
- no `quadrant_binary_weave_probe_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.md` report was created
- no persisted parent thread row appeared in `state_5.sqlite`
- no rollout session file appeared under `.codex/sessions/...`

Logs show:
- parent shell snapshot warning at `21:40:58`
- child shell snapshot warning at `21:40:58`
- several early child output items at `21:41:02`
- child `post sampling token usage` at `21:41:02`
- parent `Submission` at `21:41:02`
- no persisted thread, rollout, inbox, or report after that point

## Same-Hour Production Comparison
- production lane run id: `019ce581-399f-7dc0-a12f-cc3c431842fb`
- production child thread id: `019ce581-3abe-7c80-8ff3-edb3e46cd291`

Production showed the same parent-level persistence failure:
- production run remained `IN_PROGRESS`
- no inbox item was created
- no new production report was created in the monitored window
- no persisted thread row appeared for the production parent or child thread ids
- no rollout session file appeared for the production parent or child thread ids

Production also showed an additional child-side encoding failure that the probe did not show:
- child thread logged `UnicodeEncodeError: '\\u2011'` at `21:42:59`

## Failure Classification
Probe phase classification:
- `bootstrap fails`: supervisor or cwd or report-persistence problem

Interpretation:
- Because the probe failed during `bootstrap`, before anchor reads or raw manuscript discovery, the first failing boundary is above corpus content.
- Because the full production lane still showed a child-side Unicode failure in the same hour while the probe did not, there are at least two active problems:
  1. a minimal-lane parent persistence or supervisor handoff failure
  2. an additional full-lane child encoding problem still present in production

## Next Follow-Up
- Stop phase escalation at `bootstrap`.
- Keep probe memory on `bootstrap`; do not advance to `anchors-read`.
- Investigate the parent thread persistence or supervisor handoff failure first.
- Treat the production child-side Unicode issue as a second problem layered on top of the bootstrap failure, not as the only remaining defect.
