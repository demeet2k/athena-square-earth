# Quadrant Binary Weave First-Run Validation

Date: `2026-03-12`
Validation time: `2026-03-12T19:56:34.9930544-07:00`
Target automation: `quadrant-binary-weave`
Target run thread id: `019ce513-1572-71d1-b5aa-c08c6571e318`

## Validation Result

Status: `FAIL`

The first live run did not complete cleanly. It remained `IN_PROGRESS` without producing the required inbox artifact or ledger report.

## Scheduler State Test

Result: `PASS`

- automation id: `quadrant-binary-weave`
- name: `Quadrant Binary Weave Scan`
- status: `ACTIVE`
- cadence: `FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=1`
- cwd: `C:/Users/dmitr/Documents/Athena Agent/Quadrant Binary`
- next run at: `2026-03-12T20:42:36-07:00`
- last run at: `2026-03-12T19:42:36.692000-07:00`

## Run Progression Test

Result: `FAIL`

- latest run status: `IN_PROGRESS`
- run created at: `2026-03-12T19:42:36.836000-07:00`
- last run update: `2026-03-12T19:42:41.852000-07:00`
- elapsed without further progress at validation time: about `13m 53s`

Interpretation:

- the run stopped updating about five seconds after start
- it did not reach `PENDING_REVIEW`
- this should be treated as a stalled first run, not a successful completion awaiting review

## Artifact Test

Result: `FAIL`

Expected:

- exactly one inbox artifact
- exactly one ledger report at `quadrant_binary_weave_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.md`

Observed:

- inbox artifact count for this run: `0`
- matching ledger reports: `0`

## Content Test

Result: `NOT RUN`

The report content contract could not be validated because no QBD weave report file was produced.

The following required sections remain unverified for the first run:

- `docs gate status`
- `anchors checked`
- `neglected areas`
- `highest-yield missing bridges`
- `why they remain neglected`
- `recommended weave actions`
- `blockers`
- `restart seed`

## Regression / Coexistence Test

Result: `PASS`

- `corpus-weave-2` remains present and `ACTIVE`
- `corpus-weave-2` still points at the Athena-wide cwd: `C:/Users/dmitr/Documents/Athena Agent`
- no Athena-wide ledger report name was overwritten by the QBD lane

## Failure Classification

- `No report file`: likely write-path or run-completion failure
- `No inbox item`: output contract not reached
- `Stalled IN_PROGRESS`: run did not transition to `PENDING_REVIEW`

Not yet observed:

- `Wrong scope`
- `Missing sections`
- `Too generic / too many actions`
- `Repeated stale bridge on consecutive runs`

## Deterministic Next Move

Treat the current run as a failed first-run validation target.

The next validation target is the first subsequent `quadrant-binary-weave` run that:

1. leaves `IN_PROGRESS`
2. reaches `PENDING_REVIEW`
3. emits exactly one inbox artifact
4. writes exactly one `quadrant_binary_weave_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.md` report

Prompt changes remain out of scope until a completed run exists or the stall is root-caused at the automation engine level.
