# Quadrant Binary Weave Repaired Run Validation

Timestamp: 2026-03-12 20:54 -07:00

## Summary
The staged repair to `quadrant-binary-weave` was implemented in place by rewriting the automation prompt as ASCII-only text, preserving the lane id, name, status, cadence, and QBD-only cwd.

Static validation passed:
- `automation.toml` parses cleanly.
- The prompt contains zero non-ASCII codepoints.
- The 3 generated QBD anchors are still named explicitly.
- The single inbox item rule, single report path, and non-mutating writeback law are still present.
- `corpus-weave-2` remained untouched.

## Live Repaired Run Target
- automation id: `quadrant-binary-weave`
- repaired run id: `019ce54a-0fa4-7e13-951b-17cd08d10c7c`
- previous failed run id: `019ce513-1572-71d1-b5aa-c08c6571e318`

## What Improved
- The repaired run was picked up by the scheduler at the expected hourly slot.
- A sibling execution thread appeared for the repaired run: `019ce54a-10f8-7c61-b79e-25db09fff037`.
- The repaired run advanced past the original submission-side Unicode crash.
- No `UnicodeEncodeError` for the QBD repaired run was observed during the monitored launch window.

## What Still Failed
- The repaired run remained `IN_PROGRESS`.
- No inbox artifact was created.
- No `quadrant_binary_weave_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.md` ledger report was created.
- No persisted thread row appeared in `state_5.sqlite` for either the repaired run id or its sibling execution thread.
- No rollout session file appeared for either repaired-run thread id.

## Evidence
- `codex-dev.db` shows the repaired run row was created at `2026-03-12T20:42:39-07:00` and last updated at `2026-03-12T20:42:45-07:00`.
- `logs_1.sqlite` shows:
  - parent run shell snapshot warning at `20:42:42`
  - sibling thread submission at `20:42:43`
  - several early output items at `20:42:44` to `20:42:45`
  - no subsequent QBD artifact, thread-persistence, or completion signal in the monitored window

## Validation Result
Status: PARTIAL

The repair appears to have fixed the original submission-side encoding blocker, but the automation still stalls before thread persistence and before producing the required inbox and report artifacts.

## Next Follow-Up
Investigate the second-stage QBD launch path after model submission:
- compare the QBD repaired run against a simultaneously successful automation thread lifecycle
- inspect for supervisor or thread-persistence failures after early output items
- keep the current ASCII-safe prompt intact while diagnosing the new stall
