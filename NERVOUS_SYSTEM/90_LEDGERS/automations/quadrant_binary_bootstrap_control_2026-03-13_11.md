- automation id: quadrant-binary-bootstrap-control
- lane: temporary Quadrant Binary bootstrap control

## control phase
Bootstrap-only validation complete. Execution stopped before anchor reads and manuscript discovery.

## docs gate status
BLOCKED.
Witness:
- Trading Bot/docs_search.py exists.
- Trading Bot/credentials.json missing.
- Trading Bot/token.json missing.
- Runtime probe failed because python/py commands are unavailable in this session.

## qbd path witness
Target reachable from root cwd:
C:\Users\dmitr\Documents\Athena Agent\Quadrant Binary

## anchors checked
0 anchors checked. No anchor files opened.

## raw source status
No raw manuscript files were opened for bootstrap.

This report was written to:
C:\Users\dmitr\Documents\Athena Agent\NERVOUS_SYSTEM\90_LEDGERS\automations\quadrant_binary_bootstrap_control_2026-03-13_11.md

## blockers
- Google Docs gate remains blocked by missing OAuth files and missing Python runtime command access in this shell.

## restart seed
1. Restore Python runtime command availability (python or py) in the execution shell.
2. Place OAuth files at Trading Bot/credentials.json and Trading Bot/token.json.
3. Re-run this bootstrap lane and re-probe live docs before any deeper lane operations.
