## Traversal Modes

- `direct lookup`: exact or near-exact authoritative retrieval
- `bounded neighborhood`: browse one zone or one family without exploding scope
- `bridge walk`: cross a small number of zones or interfaces
- `metro walk`: follow higher-yield transit surfaces across the fabric
- `regeneration path`: move from seed surfaces toward writeback targets
- `audit sweep`: prefer risk and drift surfaces rather than high-authority summaries
