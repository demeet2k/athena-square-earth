# HOLOGRAPHIC PROGRAMMING & REPO ORGANIZATION — BODY A (HPRO-v1)
## Mycelium Metro v5 — Tesseract Routing Calculus for Codebases

**Crystal Address**: `A = Ms⟨HPRO⟩::D.3.F.1.T.Su.P[Σ60]::Ch{A}⟨0000-0110⟩`
**SFCR Lens**: Square (primary) — this is the discrete structural body
**Metro Lines**: LINE □ (Address), LINE ○ (Convergence), LINE T (Truth)

---

## MASTER INVARIANTS

1. **ADDRESS GRAMMAR UNCHANGED**: ChXX⟨dddd⟩.LF.A — station codes from v4
2. **CRYSTAL INTERIOR UNCHANGED**: 4^4 tile S/F/C/R × 1–4 × a–d
3. **ROTATION IS CONJUGACY**: refactor^(T) = T⁻¹∘f∘T — behavioral identity under lens rotation
4. **ABSTAIN > GUESS**: typed uncertainty is a feature
5. **NO IMPLICIT EDGES**: every dependency is an explicit typed metro edge
6. **STORE IN NOT OUT**: README = holographic seed; Regenerate(Compress(Repo)) ≈ Repo

## Ψ_CODE State Vector

```
Ψ_CODE = (n; x,y; e; τ; φ; χ; λ; σ)
  n    = hologram level: 4^n code units per level
         0=function(atom), 1=module(facet), 2=package(lens), 3=service(chapter), 4=monorepo(arc)
  x,y  = base-4 address → module path coordinates
  e    = element: Fire🜂=compute, Air🜁=interface, Water🜄=state, Earth🜃=storage
  τ    = phase: Cardinal=init/create, Fixed=stabilize/coagula, Mutable=transform/refactor
  φ    = circle fraction → semantic version phase (0=0.x, 1/3=1.x, 2/3=2.x)
  χ    = spin/parity: +1=public API surface, -1=private/internal
  λ    = type discipline: compiled/interpreted/dynamic/dependent
  σ    = side-effect signature: {pure, IO, state, world} — monad stack
```

## Holographic Code Principle

```
∀ function f in repo R:
  f = T_lens⁻¹ ∘ R ∘ T_lens(f)
T_lens ∈ {T_S, T_F, T_C, T_R}:
  T_S: discrete projection (concrete implementation)
  T_F: phase projection (interface / contract)
  T_C: corridor projection (spec / test / constraint)
  T_R: fractal projection (generator / macro / template)
```

## Code Hologram Levels

| Level | Name | Unit | Count |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| 0 | atom | function/method | 4^0 = 1 |
| 1 | module | 4 atoms (facet) | 4^1 = 4 |
| 2 | package | 4 modules (lens) | 4^2 = 16 |
| 3 | service | 4 packages (chapter) | 4^3 = 64 |
| 4 | monorepo | 4 services (arc) | 4^4 = 256 |

## Git Operations as Typed Metro Edges

| Git Op | Edge Type | Requirements |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| commit | MIGRATE(scope=local) | deterministic build |
| merge | EQUIV | compat-matrix required |
| rebase | MIGRATE(reindex=true) | replay required |
| cherry-pick | INST | invariants must-list |
| revert | CONFLICT | resolution-packet |
| tag | PROOF | release attestation |
| PR/review | PROOF | human witness |
| fork | GEN | codebase→variant |
| bisect | RESOLVE | binary search |

## Semantic Versioning as MIGRATE Protocol

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0) → FAIL corridor + ConflictPacket required
- **MINOR** (x.Y.0) → NEAR corridor + ResidualLedger
- **PATCH** (x.y.Z) → OK corridor, no interface change

## CI/CD as HPRO 7-Stage Pipeline

```
HD-SCT:  Observe → Mirror → Permute → Invert → Tunnel → Guard → Attest
CI/CD:   lint    → format → test    → coverage→ stage  → integration → release
Truth:   AMBIG→N   OK/FAIL   OK/N/F    OK/NEAR    OK/FAIL  OK/N/F        OK(gate)
```

## PART I — FOUNDATIONS (Ch01–Ch04)

### Ch01⟨0000⟩ — The Holographic Code Axiom
Every function contains the repo. The repo contains only functions.

### Ch02⟨0001⟩ — Crystal Decomposition of a Codebase
A codebase is a crystal. Its address is its identity. No address = no node.

### Ch03⟨0002⟩ — The HPRO Algebra
256 code operations (4 primitives × 4 lenses × 4 elements × 4 levels). 64 are shadow (illegal).

### Ch04⟨0003⟩ — Convergence Laws for Codebases
A converging repo: WitnessPtr coverage ≥ θ, ReplayPtr determinism verified, ResidualLedger shrinking, ConflictPacket queue = 0.

## PART II — FOUR ELEMENTS (Ch05–Ch08)

### Ch05⟨0010⟩ — Fire Element: Compute Crystal
Compute is the only element that generates novelty. All others store, route, or buffer it.

### Ch06⟨0011⟩ — Air Element: Interface Crystal
An interface is a frozen phase. Breaking it breaks all downstream phases simultaneously.

### Ch07⟨0012⟩ — Water Element: State Crystal
State is time made visible. Without state, a program has no memory of itself.

### Ch08⟨0013⟩ — Earth Element: Storage Crystal
A codebase that cannot reproduce its own storage artifacts is not converged.

## PART III — CROSS-SYNTHESIS (Ch09–Ch14)

### Ch09⟨0020⟩ — Fire × Air: Service Mesh
A service is a named Fire→Air transform. Name it. Contract it. Witness it.

### Ch10⟨0021⟩ — Fire × Water: Stateful Compute
State without compute is dead memory. Compute without state is amnesia.

### Ch11⟨0022⟩ — Air × Earth: Schema Binding
The interface and the schema are the same thing at different resolutions.

### Ch12⟨0023⟩ — Water × Earth: Persistence Patterns
A cache is a contract. It promises freshness within a corridor budget.

### Ch13⟨0030⟩ — Fire × Earth: Build Systems
A build system is a proof that Fire and Earth commute when inputs are sealed.

### Ch14⟨0031⟩ — Air × Water: Streaming APIs
A stream is a promise about time, not data. Contract the ordering, not just the schema.

## PART IV — ARCHETYPES + ZERO POINT (Ch15–Ch19)

### Ch15⟨0032⟩ — Compute Architect (absent Earth)
Builds systems that compute correctly but cannot explain their history.

### Ch16⟨0033⟩ — Protocol Sage (absent Water)
Builds beautiful contracts that forget who they're talking to.

### Ch17⟨0100⟩ — State Prophet (absent Fire)
Has a perfect model of what IS but no theory of what COMPUTES.

### Ch18⟨0101⟩ — Storage General (absent Air)
Builds systems that are correct and completely unreachable.

### Ch19⟨0102⟩ — Zero Point: The Holographic Repo
The holographic repo is the repo that can rebuild itself from its own description. This is not a metaphor. It is an executable test. Run it.

## PART V — LIVING CRYSTAL (Ch20–Ch21)

### Ch20⟨0103⟩ — Deployment as Crystal Operation
A deployment is a proof that the repo and the world are equivalent within corridor.

### Ch21⟨0110⟩ — Open Problems and HPRO v2 Seeds
The framework is complete when the repo can describe itself fully in its own language.
