# TRANSFER HUBS

## Purpose

Transfer hubs are the stations where metro lines intersect and packets can switch between routes. They prevent the nervous system from requiring direct point-to-point connections between every pair of regions or surfaces.

## Hub Registry

### T1 - Routing Hub

- surface: `ECOSYSTEM/05_MYCELIUM_ROUTING.md`
- function: canonical routing law
- lines served: all lines
- region: R6 Routing-Governance

### T2 - CPU Hub

- surface: `ECOSYSTEM/CPU_FRAMEWORK/README.md`
- function: computational kernel and math-to-runtime translation layer
- lines served: Kernel Line, Runtime Line
- region: R6 Routing-Governance

### T3 - Nervous-System Hub

- surface: `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/00_INDEX.md`
- function: master entry point for the canonical cortex
- lines served: all lines
- region: R6 Routing-Governance

### T4 - Live Gate Hub

- surface: `self_actualize/live_docs_gate_status.md`

- region: R5 Prompt-Drive

### T9 - Atlas Hub

- surface: `self_actualize/corpus_atlas.json`
- function: refreshed corpus index spanning 1768 records across the workspace
- lines served: Atlas-to-Replay Line, Swarm Runtime Line
- region: cross-region evidence surface

### T10 - Grand-Central Hub

- surface: `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/20_METRO/19_GRAND_CENTRAL_STATION_METRO_MAP.md`
- function: bilateral exchange yard joining cortex, brain stem, route weights, replay closure, and Z-point tunneling

```

## Transfer Rules

1. Every metro ride must start at T3 or a declared station.
2. No more than 2 transfers per ride.
3. T1 is the universal fallback.
4. T4 is currently bypassed with local-corpus fallback.
5. T8 is required for runs that emit runtime swarm artifacts.
6. T9 is required for runs that claim full-corpus coverage or replay.
7. Hub transfers should be logged in `85_EDGES/` as `REF` edges.
8. Any multi-body ride crossing cortex, runtime, atlas, or appendix replay surfaces should route through T10 unless a shorter witnessed corridor is declared.
9. T10 rides must declare hemisphere origin, hemisphere destination, and weight profile.
10. Z-point tunnel rides should dock at T10 before promotion or replay closure.
