# REF EDGES (Cross-Chapter)

## Purpose

Records cross-chapter dependencies where one chapter explicitly depends on another's content to be interpreted correctly.

## Notes

- Truth class NEAR indicates these dependencies are structurally clear but the actual content binding is not yet replay-verified
- Promotion to OK requires populating both source and destination tile slots
