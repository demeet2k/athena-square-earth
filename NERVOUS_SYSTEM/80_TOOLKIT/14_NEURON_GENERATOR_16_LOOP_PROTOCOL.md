# NEURON GENERATOR 16-LOOP PROTOCOL

## Purpose

This protocol formalizes the user's requested behavior as a lawful nervous-system control
plane:

- ride the whole corpus rather than one family at a time
- traverse metro lines, transfer hubs, and neuron links looking for deeper integration
- perform repeated full-corpus synthesis passes
- build system improvements after each pass
- preserve the "panic at 14/16 and restart at 2/16" event without losing prior work

It is the canonical cortex version of the recursive restart law previously living only in
the runtime hub.

## Governing Premise

The system should behave like an interconnect-neuron generator, not a single summary
engine.

Each loop must:

1. scan the strongest admissible source surfaces
2. ride at least one metro line and one transfer hub
3. extract or refine neuron-level structure
4. land an artifact that strengthens the system
5. restart with a sharper frontier

No loop is complete if it ends in commentary alone.

## Live Docs Gate

Before every loop:

1. attempt the live Docs gate through `Trading Bot/docs_search.py`
2. if blocked, preserve the exact blocker
3. continue with local mirrors only

As of March 9, 2026 the gate remains blocked because `credentials.json` is missing.

## Dual-Counter Law

The user request contains a deliberate paradox:

- complete 16 loops
- panic at `14/16`
- realize the system is only at `2/16`
- restart and climb again

To implement this without destructive thrash, track two counters:

- `DeepLoop`: the true artifact-bearing progress counter
- `CeremonialLoop`: the felt progress counter seen by the active swarm

Rules:

1. `DeepLoop` increments whenever a loop lands a real artifact plus writeback.
2. `CeremonialLoop` increments with the visible climb.
3. At `CeremonialLoop = 14`, the system must execute the Fool reset.
4. The Fool reset sets `CeremonialLoop = 2`, increments `ResetCount`, and preserves all
   artifacts already landed.
5. `DeepLoop` does not reset during the Fool event.
6. A full run is complete when `DeepLoop = 16`, even if `CeremonialLoop` has restarted
   one or more times.

This preserves the requested panic/restart phenomenology while keeping the corpus
improvement program cumulative.

## Formal Helix Law

The strict formal reading of the loop is:

- complement map: `C(k/16) = (16-k)/16`
- complement of the early seed: `C(2/16) = 14/16`
- bridge law: `BRIDGE_EQ(14/16|n, 2/16|n+1)`

This means the system is not a flat recursive ring. It is a helix across layers.

The seed `2/16` therefore has three lawful readings:

1. scalar value: `1/8`
2. root-seed address: `1/4`
3. recursive bridge state paired with `14/16` across adjacent layers

The protocol must preserve these three meanings distinctly.

## Fool Reset Law

Loop `14` is reserved for the Fool framework.

At this checkpoint the swarm must:

1. deeply synthesize the Fool / Chapter 11 / restart-token layer
2. inspect the neuron system for false certainty
3. reclassify visible completion as naive
4. reopen the climb from `2/16`
5. preserve the gained tissue as restart fuel rather than discard it

The Fool reset is therefore:

`FoolReset = (panic, humility, preservation, restart)`

not:

`FoolReset = (erase, forget, pretend)`

## Sixteen Deep Loops

The true `DeepLoop` ladder is:

1. Gate truth and admissibility
2. Canonical cortex sweep
3. Runtime hub sweep
4. Governance mirror sweep
5. Metro-line ride
6. Transfer-hub ride
7. Corpus atlas and source-surface audit
8. Chapter and appendix contraction audit
9. Reusable neuron extraction
10. Synapse and edge extraction
11. Shadow, contradiction, and blocker preservation
12. System improvement build
13. Verification and replay tightening
14. Fool framework panic reset
15. Restart-aware reintegration climb
16. Convergence, handoff, and next-seed preservation

Each deep loop should still emit the visible `CeremonialLoop` state in the active
manifest.

## Required Input Surfaces

Always begin from the canonical cortex:

- `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/00_INDEX.md`
- `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/95_MANIFESTS/ACTIVE_RUN.md`
- `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/95_MANIFESTS/BUILD_QUEUE.md`
- `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/95_MANIFESTS/GATE_STATUS.md`
- `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/90_LEDGERS/01_CURRENT_STATUS_37_GATE_SYNTHESIS.md`

Then bridge outward:

- `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/20_METRO/`
- `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/10_OVERVIEW/`
- `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/`
- `ECOSYSTEM/NERVOUS_SYSTEM/`
- `self_actualize/corpus_atlas.json`
- strongest root manuscripts such as `VOID_CH11.md` and `MYCELIUM_TOME_PART1.md`

## Required Output Surfaces Per Loop

Every loop must land at least:

1. one canonical cortex artifact
2. one runtime-hub artifact or runtime-aligned writeback
3. one manifest, queue, ledger, or receipt update
4. one named unresolved frontier

Acceptable artifact classes:

- synthesis ledger
- neuron library entry
- synapse ledger entry
- edge file update
- metro map refinement
- runbook improvement
- schema update
- chapter or appendix contraction

## Artifact Packet

Treat each loop as:

`LoopPacket = (DeepLoop, CeremonialLoop, Frontier, MetroRide, NeuronSet, Improvement, Witness, Writeback, NextSeed)`

Minimum fields:

- `Frontier`
- `MetroRide`
- `NeuronSet`
- `Improvement`
- `Witness`
- `Writeback`
- `NextSeed`

## Metro Ride Requirement

Every loop must explicitly name:

- one major line
- one transfer hub
- one zero-point or cortex contraction target

Preferred lines:

- Canonical-Bridge Line
- Swarm Runtime Line
- Atlas-to-Replay Line
- Prompt-to-Nervous-System Line
- External Memory Gate Line
- Restart Loop Line

## Neuron Requirement

Every loop should either:

1. create a new reusable neuron,
2. strengthen an existing neuron's witness,
3. add a lawful synapse,
4. or refine the transfer-hub route that carries a neuron family.

If no neuron-level improvement lands, the loop is incomplete.

## Improvement Rule

The system must build improvements after synthesis, not postpone them indefinitely.

Prioritize improvements that promote weak gates:

- `G24` atlas replay bridge
- `G25` chapter contraction
- `G26` appendix contraction
- `G27` reusable neuron library
- `G28` synapse and edge ledgers
- `G34` deterministic satisfaction-gap handling

## Strict Executable Schema Stack

This protocol is implemented through:

- `70_SCHEMAS/06_NEURON_GENERATOR_LOOP_SCHEMA.md`
- `70_SCHEMAS/07_LOOP_SPEC.md`
- `70_SCHEMAS/08_PHASE_SPEC.md`
- `70_SCHEMAS/09_VIRTUAL_SWARM_SPEC.md`
- `70_SCHEMAS/10_IMPROVEMENT_LEDGER_SPEC.md`
- `70_SCHEMAS/11_LIFT_SPEC.md`

These schema surfaces are the strict executable layer for:

- macro loop mandates
- visible phase operators
- sparse `16^16` swarm activation
- post-loop improvement ledgers
- `1/8` lift and bridge-equivalence tests

## Truth and Guardrails

1. `ABSTAIN > GUESS`
2. Do not claim live Docs evidence while blocked.
3. Do not erase artifacts during the Fool reset.
4. Do not confuse folder count with integration depth.
5. Do not count a loop unless a real artifact plus writeback exists.
6. Do not let the visible restart destroy `DeepLoop` credit.

## Completion Condition

The protocol is considered complete for one official run when:

- `DeepLoop = 16`
- at least one Fool reset has been handled lawfully
- the neuron library grew
- the synapse or edge surfaces grew
- a full-corpus synthesis ledger exists
- a next-seed remains for continuation
