# Athena FLEET Graph Contraction

Date: `2026-03-13`
Truth: `OK`
Body: `A16`
Promotion bar: `A16 local closure only`
Docs gate: `BLOCKED`

## Family

- family_surface: `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/families/FAMILY_athena_fleet.md`
- family_truth: `OK`

## Route

- route_surface: `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/routes/whole_crystal/ROUTE_athena_fleet.md`
- authority_state: `canonical-corridor`
- route_state: `Route is now locally closed around `A16 -> A06` and `A16 -> A15` before any downstream corridor promotion.`

## Direct Edges

- `CS-001` `Athena FLEET -> Voynich` :: `A16 -> GCL+GCR -> GCZ -> A06` :: weight=`0.96`
- `CS-003` `Athena FLEET -> ORGIN` :: `A16 -> GCL+GCR -> GCP -> A15` :: weight=`0.91`

## Bridge-Family Routes

- `BF-CS-001` :: edge=`CS-001` :: truth=`OK` :: route=`A16 -> GCL+GCR -> GCZ -> A06`
- `BF-CS-003` :: edge=`CS-003` :: truth=`OK` :: route=`A16 -> GCL+GCR -> GCP -> A15`

## Handoff Packets

- `SHP-002` :: `A16 -> A06` :: `A16 -> GCL+GCR -> GCZ -> A06`
- `SHP-004` :: `A16 -> A15` :: `A16 -> GCL+GCR -> GCP -> A15 -> A02`

## Remaining External Deficits

- `LEG-C2` `athena-fleet-to-trading-bot` :: truth=`NEAR` :: Fleet can route into the Trading Bot truth corridor, but live Docs ingress remains blocker-bound and must stay explicit.
- `LEG-C3` `athena-fleet-to-athena-os-runtime` :: truth=`NEAR` :: Athena OS participates as a verified runtime leg, but it still lacks a separate family membrane inside the core corridor.
- `LEG-C4` `athena-fleet-to-orgin-seed` :: truth=`NEAR` :: ORGIN is routed as a secondary seed leg through its atlas and route map, but mirrored markdown packets are not landed yet.

## Law

- `A16` is now treated as locally closed when the family surface, route surface, direct edges, bridge-family routes, and handoff packets agree.
- `LEG-C2`, `LEG-C3`, and `LEG-C4` remain explicit downstream deficits and do not invalidate local `A16` closure.
- next_seed: `Q35`
