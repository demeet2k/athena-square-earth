# INTERCONNECT NEURON

## 1. Definition

Definition 1.1 (Interconnect Neuron).
An interconnect neuron is a routed bundle

`IN = (region_set, task_seed, synapse_set, metro_path, witness_state, contraction_target)`

that pulls information from multiple corpus regions, holds their differences long enough
to compare them, and then contracts them into one higher-order synthesis packet.

## 2. Why the Project Already Behaves Like a Nervous System

The workspace is not organized as one book or one codebase. It already behaves like
a distributed organism:

- `MATH` acts as the formal cortex,
- `Voynich` acts as an executable manuscript hippocampus,
- `NERUAL NETWORK` acts as the adaptive motor and experiment layer,
- `self_actualize` acts as the motivational and prompt-control layer,
- `Trading Bot` acts as the sensory gateway to live Docs,
- `ECOSYSTEM` acts as the spinal cord and routing law surface.

The missing layer was the interconnect neuron: a structure that explicitly maps
how information should travel between these regions.

## 3. Interconnect Law

The interconnect neuron follows:

`source cells -> region synthesis -> cross-region synapse -> metro route -> final contraction`

Expanded form:

`many local shards -> one regional node -> many regional nodes -> one active route -> one artifact`

## 4. Nervous-System Objective

The nervous system optimizes:

1. high recall across the full corpus,
2. lawful cross-domain transport,
3. metro-map retrieval instead of ad hoc browsing,
4. packetized parallel work instead of scattered prompting,
5. contraction back into stable canonical markdown.

## 5. Active Gate

The current system gate remains:

- live Google Docs access is blocked because `credentials.json` is missing.

Therefore the nervous system currently operates in local-corpus mode with explicit
fallback to extracted markdown, text mirrors, and promoted synthesis files.
