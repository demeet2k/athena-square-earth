| Q-ROUTE | route | SC-01, SC-02, SC-04, SC-05, SC-06, SC-13 | QUARANTINE on immune risk, otherwise REPAIR or PROMOTE |
| Q-NEGLECT | neglect | SC-01, SC-08, SC-09, SC-10, SC-12, SC-13 | REPAIR when neglected surfaces exist |
| Q-FIRE | fire | SC-03, SC-04, SC-05, SC-06, SC-10, SC-11, SC-13 | TopK wave slices only |
| Q-PROMOTE | promote | SC-01, SC-04, SC-05, SC-09, SC-10, SC-13 | PROMOTE only when witness, replay, and boundary clear floor |
