# PHASE SPEC 2-TO-14 MACHINE

## Purpose

This schema defines the visible helical working cycle from `2/16` through `14/16`.

The machine is not a flat circle.
`14/16` is the pre-closure band whose lawful output is the lifted seed at `2/16` one level higher.

## Phase Law

For loop `lambda` at dimension `n`:

`X_(n,lambda)^(2) -> X_(n,lambda)^(3) -> ... -> X_(n,lambda)^(14)`

with lift:

`X_(n+1,lambda)^(2) = L(X_(n,lambda)^(14))`

```

## Transition Contract

Every phase must expose:

1. `operator`
2. `input_state`
3. `output_state`
4. `witness`
5. `metric_delta`
6. `residual`
7. `restart_seed`

No phase transition is complete if it produces commentary without an output state or witness.

## Lift Boundary

Phase `14` is the only lawful place where:

`14/16|n ≡ 2/16|n+1`

can be applied.

Within a layer, `2/16` and `14/16` are complements.
Across layers, `14/16` becomes the bridge state that re-enters as `2/16`.
