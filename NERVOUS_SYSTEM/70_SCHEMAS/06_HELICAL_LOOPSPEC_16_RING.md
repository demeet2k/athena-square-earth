# HELICAL LOOPSPEC 16-RING

## Purpose

This schema makes the `2/16 <-> 14/16` recursion rigorous inside Athena's control plane.

The core discipline is:

- scalar arithmetic is not recursive bridge identity
- complement inside one layer is not the same as lift across layers
- `14/16|n ≡ 2/16|n+1` is a typed bridge-equivalence, not scalar equality

## Typed Equivalence Law

Arithmetic value:

`2/16 = 1/8`

Recursive bridge value:

`C_n(2) = 14`

`L_n(14) = 2_(n+1)`

`(L_n o C_n)(2_n) = 2_(n+1)`

This is therefore a fixed orbit type, not a flat fixed point.

## Admissibility Rule

Promote a helical loop architecture only when:

1. complement and lift are explicitly separated,
2. the visible `2/16 -> 14/16` window is named,
3. all 16 macro-loop mandates are assigned,
4. the loop points to phase, swarm, ledger, and lift schemas,
5. the loop preserves the six invariants across dimensions.
