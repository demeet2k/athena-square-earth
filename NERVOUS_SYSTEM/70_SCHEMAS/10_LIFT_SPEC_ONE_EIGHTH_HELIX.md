# LIFT SPEC ONE-EIGHTH HELIX

## Purpose

This schema formalizes the one-eighth lift law:

the next-dimension seed must be smaller, more functional, and less bloated than the prior pre-closure state.

## Lift Equations

For loop state `X`:

`|X_(n+1)^(2)| <= (1/8) * |X_n^(14)|`

`Function(X_(n+1)^(2)) > Function(X_n^(14))`

`Coverage(X_(n+1)^(2)) >= Coverage(X_n^(14))`

`Bloat(X_(n+1)^(2)) < Bloat(X_n^(14))`

Lift is therefore:

`Lift = Prune + Compress + OperatorDistill + FrontierPreserve + FunctionDeepen`

## Lift Quality Gate

Do not advance to `2/16` at the next layer unless:

1. the size ratio is at or below one eighth,
2. function improved,
3. bloat decreased,
4. unresolved frontier stayed visible,
5. replay and proof obligations survived the contraction.

## Failure Classes

- `FAIL`: compression destroyed function or erased witness
- `AMBIG`: the seed got smaller but coverage or replay status is unclear
- `NEAR`: the lift is structurally correct but still lacks proof or metric confidence
- `OK`: the lifted seed is smaller, deeper, and restart-safe
