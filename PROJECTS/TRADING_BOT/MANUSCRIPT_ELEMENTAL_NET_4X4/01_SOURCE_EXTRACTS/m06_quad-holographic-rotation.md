        QUAD HOLOGRAPHIC ROTATION
Rotation is Conjugacy: A Proof-Carrying Holographic Tunneling Calculus with the Quad-Polar Generator Basis and the 256-Operation Crystal
Extended Abstract
1. Scope and deliverable
This manuscript specifies a single executable, proof-carrying framework for:
Defining laws (mathematical, physical, computational, statistical) as typed semantic objects with explicit admissibility domains, branch conventions, and residual semantics.
Transporting laws between representations without semantic drift, by treating every representation change as a typed transport whose meaning preservation is stated and verified as a conjugacy/commutation obligation.
Classifying truth by a non-boolean corridor lattice (\mathbb T={\mathrm{OK},\mathrm{NEAR},\mathrm{AMBIG},\mathrm{FAIL}}) with the governing rule ABSTAIN > GUESS: no silent coercions, no unrecorded dependencies, no implicit equivalences.
Detecting illegality via a finite catalogue of “no-go” classes (the Shadow Crystal) that are enforced as compile-time and proof-time constraints.
Resolving illegality by certified routing: when a direct move is blocked, the system produces a route over a proof-carrying graph of meaning transfers (the MyceliumGraph), emitting a CandidateSet/EvidencePlan if the route cannot be certified within corridor budgets.
Implementing tunneling as a certified phenomenon: a change of representation that preserves a declared invariant fiber while changing only a quotient observable, producing “teleportation” in a lower-resolution view without altering the higher-resolution state.
Automating verification through deterministic replay and certification workflows that compile every OK claim into a replay script, transcript commitments, and witness manifests.
The manuscript is therefore not a narrative of proofs, but an operational calculus: a corpus of typed objects (definitions, transforms, programs) plus certifiable transitions between them.
2. Core thesis: representation change is a typed transport, not interpretation
The foundational invariant is:
[\textbf{Rotation is Conjugacy.}]
Every admissible change of representation is a typed transform (T) between carriers, and the only permissible way to transport meaning is conjugacy transport:
[f^{(T)} ;:=; T^{-1}\circ f\circ T.]
This rule is universal: it transports equations, dynamics, constraints, fixed points, and invariants by construction, provided (T) is admissible on a declared domain and the inverse/branches are explicitly pinned.
A lens is formalized as an admissible bijection (T:D\to\mathbb R) (or (T:D\to\mathbb C)) with declared regularity and branch policy. For any operator (f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R), its transported operator on (D) is (f_T=T^{-1}\circ f\circ T). Meaning preservation is therefore not a human interpretation; it is a typed transport obligation accompanied by a domain/branch certificate.
All nontrivial “equivalences” in the manuscript reduce to one of:
exact conjugacy,
bounded (NEAR) conjugacy with defect ledger,
constructive ambiguity (AMBIG) with CandidateSet + EvidencePlan,
obstruction (FAIL) with minimal witness.
3. Semantic unit: presentations, residuals, admissibility
A law is not a single equation; it is an equivalence class of presentations with explicit admissibility and residual semantics.
A presentation is a typed quadruple[\mathcal P=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0),]with satisfaction semantics[x\models \mathcal P \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \Phi(x)\in\mathbb V_0.]When (\mathbb V) is normed and (\mathbb V_0={0}), the canonical residual is[\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}(x)=|\Phi(x)|.]
Admissibility is first-class: each presentation carries explicit domains, branch declarations (for multivalued primitives), boundary conditions, and regularity requirements. Transforms are admissible only when all required domains/branches are satisfied under composition.
This single semantics supports:
algebraic equalities and zero sets,
PDE and variational formulations,
discrete approximations and refinement ladders,
probabilistic laws (constraints on measures/kernels),
multiscale/RG fixed-point constraints and universality suites.
4. Execution substrate: the proof-carrying metro graph of meaning transfers
All knowledge is routable only through an explicit directed multigraph:
GlobalAddr names every atomic concept (addressing system).
MyceliumGraph (\mathcal G=(V,E)) stores all legal meaning transfers:
(V={\text{GlobalAddr atoms}}),
(E={\text{LinkEdge records}}).
A LinkEdge is the mandatory unit of semantic transport:[e=(\mathrm{EdgeID},\mathrm{Kind},\mathrm{Src},\mathrm{Dst},\mathrm{Scope},\mathrm{CorridorID},\mathrm{WitnessPtr},\mathrm{ReplayPtr},\mathrm{Payload},\mathrm{EdgeVer}).]
Edge Kind is chosen from the closed basis:[\mathcal K={\mathrm{REF},\mathrm{EQUIV},\mathrm{MIGRATE},\mathrm{DUAL},\mathrm{GEN},\mathrm{INST},\mathrm{IMPL},\mathrm{PROOF},\mathrm{CONFLICT}}.]
There are no implicit edges. Any unrecorded dependency, equivalence, or transport is invalid under CORE and must evaluate to FAIL when detected by closure or conformance scans.
5. Truth is non-boolean: corridor truth lattice and abstention law
The framework is governed by a closed truth lattice:[\mathbb T={\mathrm{OK},\mathrm{NEAR},\mathrm{AMBIG},\mathrm{FAIL}}.]
OK: closure holds under corridor policy; witnesses and deterministic replay succeed; all required defects are within tolerance; no unresolved strict obligations.
NEAR: bounded approximation; all approximation terms are ledgered; stability and defect bounds are certified within corridor tolerances; open obligations are explicitly permitted and enumerated.
AMBIG: constructive uncertainty; output includes a CandidateSet and an EvidencePlan that terminates within pinned budgets or yields formal abstention.
FAIL: illegality or unverifiability; output includes minimal witness (minimal failure core) and quarantine triggers.
Abstention precedence: whenever uniqueness, admissibility, or closure cannot be certified, the system must return AMBIG/FAIL with structured evidence, never silent coercion.
6. Four lenses as the minimal atlas of appearances
The manuscript enforces a four-lens atlas as a minimal complete set of charts:
Square: discrete/formal/structural constraints (kernels, ranks, projectors, discrete legality).
Flower: symmetry/coherence/geometric structure (groupoids, commuting diagrams, gauge, holonomy).
Cloud: probabilistic/information/ensemble semantics (measures, estimators, uncertainty ledgers, identifiability).
Fractal: multiscale/recursion/RG structure (scale ladders, contraction, drift/twist, universality).
This atlas is not symbolism; it is an extraction interface. Every chapter is written in the same 4-lens layout so that definitions, transforms, algorithms, and certificates are deterministically locatable and mechanically indexable.
7. Quad-polar generator basis and the master flow
Hybrid dynamics are modeled as flows generated by operators (G) acting on state/observable spaces:[U_t := e^{tG},]interpreted as a semigroup or a group depending on reversibility.
A minimal tetrad of irreducible generator types is introduced:
(D): dissipative / constraint-rigid (contractive, Lyapunov-decreasing),
(\Omega): oscillatory / coherent (Hamiltonian/unitary/symplectic),
(\Sigma): stochastic / ensemble (Markov mixing/noise),
(\Psi): recursive / multiscale (coarse-grain, RG, multigrid/wavelets).
A general hybrid generator is:[G=\alpha_D D+\alpha_\Omega\Omega+\alpha_\Sigma\Sigma+\alpha_\Psi\Psi,]with coefficients (\alpha) living on an operator simplex (tetrahedral control manifold), whose edges enumerate dyadic couplings and whose faces encode triadic regimes.
This basis provides a uniform operator language for physics solvers, inference pipelines, and self-stabilizing systems.
8. Seeds and zero-calculus: “store in, not out”
Constants and operators are forged as certified zero objects: solutions of constraint systems equipped with existence/uniqueness/enclosure certificates and optional hardening (jet constraints). These objects are stored as seeds: compact generators plus witness/replay commitments that deterministically regenerate expansions.
This yields a compression contract:[\mathrm{Compress}(\mathrm{Expand}(\mathrm{Seed}))=\mathrm{Seed},]under pinned policy. Seeds are the canonical “store in, not out” mechanism for building large proof-carrying corpora without bulk textual redundancy.
9. The 256-operation Crystal ISA and the Shadow Crystal (no-go catalogue)
A central deliverable is an explicit instruction set architecture built from a 4-dimensional lattice:
[4\text{ constants }(\pi,e,i,\varphi)\times 4\text{ shapes }(\text{Square,Flower,Cloud,Fractal})\times 4\text{ elements }\times 4\text{ levels }(L0\text{–}L3)=256.]
L0: definitional/identity tier,
L1: transport/rotation tier,
L2: algorithm/construction tier,
L3: certification/sealing tier.
Paired to the ISA is the Shadow Crystal: 64 anti-expressions formed by projecting four canonical failure modes through the four shapes across four levels. The canonical no-go types are:
Combinatorial collapse (Earth): collapse without scale (information destroyed while claimed preserved).
Analytic singularity / improper limits (Water): singular crossing without tunneling; unregularized divergence coerced to finite value.
Dynamical blow-up (Fire): runaway amplification, false periodicity under expansion, finite-time infinite energy claims.
False unitarity / false invertibility (Air): perfect reconstruction from insufficient data; alias or rank loss disguised as reversible transform.
Operationally: every derivation/transform is checked against this taxonomy. If a no-go triggers, the system must produce FAIL/AMBIG and/or a certified tunnel route; it may never silently coerce.
10. Holographic tunneling: quotient motion with frozen fiber
Holographic tunneling is formalized as a certified phenomenon where a transformation changes only a coarse observable digit while leaving a huge internal coordinate invariant, yielding apparent teleportation at low resolution.
On a refined circle grid[M_d = 15\cdot 3^{d+4},]with additive step (u\mapsto u+s\pmod{M_d}) at snap octave (s=3^{d+5}), the orbit collapses to 5 and the visible station projection[\sigma(u)=\left\lfloor \frac{u}{3^{d+4}}\right\rfloor\in\mathbb Z_{15}]advances by (+3\pmod{15}) each step (one of three 5-cycles), while the internal remainder[q(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}]is strictly invariant along the tunnel: (q(u_{t+1})=q(u_t)).
Tunneling is therefore:[(\sigma,q)\longmapsto (\sigma+3,\ q),]i.e., motion on a quotient space with frozen fiber. The same phenomenon admits conjugate multiplicative/additive forms (scale-multiplication vs stride-addition), unified by the rotation-as-conjugacy doctrine.
11. Routing, snap stabilization, and computational closure
When a direct move is blocked (Shadow/no-go) or ambiguous:
Truth lattice output: emit FAIL/AMBIG with minimal witness and evidence plan when required.
Router: search the MyceliumGraph for an admissible route of edge kinds under corridor constraints, producing a canonical path normal form and route hash.
Compile: turn the route into explicit LinkEdges with WitnessPtr/ReplayPtr commitments.
Snap stabilization: apply rotate → clamp → rotate-back iteration (alternating projections / averaged operators) until defect energies contract or abstain.
Seal: produce module seals, snapshots, regression tests, and CI-style verification artifacts.
Deliverables include:
a formal rotation groupoid and commuting-diagram calculus,
corridor policy algebra and certificate library,
ISA + no-go lattice,
tunneling theorems (partial freeze, snap),
kernel implementation spec (schemas, hashing, serialization),
deterministic replay harness and certification automation,
domain packs (Four Forces; Bio/Mind/Society/AI).

QUAD HOLOGRAPHIC ROTATION — Rotation is Conjugacy: A Proof-Carrying Holographic Tunneling Calculus with the Quad-Polar Generator Basis and the 256-Operation Crystal
Chapter 1 — The Crystal Addressing System & Memory Map (Addr ⟨0000⟩₄)
1.1 Square — Addressable atoms
1.1.1 Objects
1.1.1.1 GlobalAddr grammar and canonical forms
A GlobalAddr is a globally unique, content-independent locator for an atomic manuscript object (“atom”), defined as a typed, version-aware, lens-aware coordinate in a four-axis crystal. Each address is a normalized tuple:[\mathrm{GlobalAddr} := (\mathrm{CorpusID},\ \mathrm{EditionID},\ \mathrm{PathID},\ \mathrm{TileID},\ \mathrm{AtomID})]with the following components:
CorpusID: immutable corpus namespace (ASCII, uppercase, hyphen allowed).
EditionID: semantic version line for stable references (e.g., vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), used only for resolution when multiple editions coexist; canonical references may omit EditionID under default policy.
PathID: hierarchical location in the treatise (Part, Chapter, Section) expressed as dot-separated integers with fixed-width padding rules.
TileID: the 4^4 crystal coordinate, expressed as a base-4 digit string ⟨d1 d2 d3 d4⟩₄, where each digit (d_k \in {0,1,2,3}) indexes a fixed axis.
AtomID: local atomic selector inside a tile (optional when the tile itself is atomic; required when a tile hosts multiple atoms such as definition + theorem + algorithm + certificate).
The canonical string form is:[\texttt{CORPUS[:EDITION]::Ppp.Ccc.Ssss::⟨d1d2d3d4⟩₄[:ATOM]}]Canonicalization rules enforce:
uppercase CORPUS, lowercase v prefix for editions,
fixed-width numeric fields for P, C, S to stabilize lexical sorting,
base-4 digits without separators and with explicit subscript marker ₄,
ATOM restricted to a closed enum (e.g., DEF, THM, ALG, CERT, NOTE), never free text.
A GlobalAddr is semantic (it identifies “the” intended atom) but must be content-stable across formatting, layout, and pagination changes.
1.1.1.2 Chapter/section addressing as retrieval tiles
A retrieval tile is a deterministic, fixed-resolution unit of knowledge extraction. The manuscript is partitioned into tiles by a cartesian product of axes:
Axis A (Lens): {Square, Flower, Cloud, Fractal}
Axis B (Facet): {Objects, Calculus, Algorithms, Certificates}
Axis C (Depth): {Subchapter, Subsection, Subsubsection, Atom}
Axis D (Local index): {0,1,2,3} base-4 digit within the chosen depth
The TileID ⟨d1d2d3d4⟩₄ serves as the constant-size addressable key for indexing and retrieval. For Chapter 1, the root is ⟨0000⟩₄ by convention; each child section refines the coordinate by incrementing the digit associated with its axis.
Retrieval is performed by:
Resolving a human-facing reference (e.g., “1.2.3.4”) to a (PathID, TileID, AtomID) triple.
Loading the tile payload via TileID (O(1) expected under hashed index).
Selecting the atom by AtomID (O(1) for bounded enumerations).
Tiles are designed to be:
uniform in structure (same subheading pattern), and
local in dependencies (explicit refs only),so that extraction is stable under compression, summarization, and code generation.
1.1.1.3 Scope typing: INTRA/INTER/EXTERNAL
Every reference and every GlobalAddr is assigned a scope type that controls legality of resolution, caching, and replay guarantees:
INTRA: within the same Chapter boundary; path-resolved locally; guarantees tight referential closure within the chapter’s index.
INTER: across chapters within the same CorpusID and EditionID policy; requires chapter indices to be present; may induce deferred obligations if target chapter is not loaded.
EXTERNAL: outside the treatise corpus; requires a pinned external identifier (hash, DOI, repository commit, dataset fingerprint); never resolves by “name only”.
Scope is attached to references as a mandatory tag:[\mathrm{Ref} := (\mathrm{RefText},\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{ResolutionPolicy},\ \mathrm{TargetHint})]Resolution policies include:
STRICT: must resolve to exactly one GlobalAddr, else FAIL,
WEAK: may resolve to CandidateSet, else AMBIG with EvidencePlan,
PINNED: external references require explicit fingerprint.
Scope typing prevents silent drift by forbidding implicit cross-corpus name collisions and by enforcing explicit pinning at EXTERNAL boundaries.
1.1.1.4 Normal forms for addresses and references
A normal form (NF) is a deterministic canonical representation of addresses and references that supports:
stable hashing,
stable sorting,
stable diffing across versions.
NF rules:
Whitespace-free: all whitespace removed except inside explicitly quoted literals.
Canonical casing: CORPUS uppercase; edition tags normalized; atom tags uppercase.
Numeric padding: Ppp.Ccc.Ssss use fixed widths per treatise configuration.
Tile normalization: base-4 digits must be length 4, with explicit ⟨ ⟩₄ markers.
Reference expansion: relative references must be expanded to absolute GlobalAddr when serialized into indices or replay transcripts.
Reference normal form:[\mathrm{RefNF} := (\mathrm{SrcGlobalAddr},\ \mathrm{TargetGlobalAddr},\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{Kind},\ \mathrm{Policy})]where Kind is the semantic role of the reference (definitional, dependency, citation, test, proof obligation), enabling selective closure checks.
1.1.2 Calculus
1.1.2.1 Address composition and namespace rules
Address composition defines how partial coordinates and relative paths compose into GlobalAddr. Let a context be:[\Gamma := (\mathrm{CorpusID},\ \mathrm{EditionID},\ \mathrm{PathID},\ \mathrm{TileID})]A relative address is a partial tuple lacking one or more leading components. Composition is a total function:[\oplus:\Gamma \times \mathrm{RelAddr}\to\mathrm{GlobalAddr}\cup{\mathrm{AMBIG},\mathrm{FAIL}}]with rules:
Namespace precedence: if CORPUS is present in RelAddr, it overrides context; otherwise context is inherited.
Edition inheritance: edition is inherited unless explicitly specified; cross-edition refs are INTER and must be declared.
Path concatenation: relative section numbers are interpreted within the current PathID scope, with .. allowed only within INTRA scope.
Tile refinement: a shorter tile fragment may be permitted only if it uniquely resolves within the current tile map; otherwise AMBIG.
Namespace rules enforce that no address may be formed without an explicit CorpusID in the final GlobalAddr; “implicit default corpus” is disallowed in serialized artifacts.
1.1.2.2 Deterministic resolution of relative → global refs
Resolution is defined as a deterministic, side-effect-free computation:[\mathrm{Resolve}(\Gamma, r) \mapsto \mathrm{RefNF}]Determinism constraints:
identical inputs must produce identical outputs,
if multiple candidates exist, the output must be AMBIG (never choose arbitrarily),
tie-break rules must be explicit and stable (lex order of GlobalAddrNF, then lowest PathID, then lowest TileID).
Resolution stages:
Parse RelAddr into typed tokens (path tokens, tile tokens, atom tokens).
Infer scope (INTRA/INTER/EXTERNAL) if not explicitly specified; inference must be conservative (upgrade to INTER/EXTERNAL rather than assume INTRA).
Lookup candidates in the retrieval index for the inferred scope.
Disambiguate using declared hints (kind, atom tag, lens/facet constraints).
Finalize a single TargetGlobalAddr or return CandidateSet with EvidencePlan.
Resolution is a pure function in the kernel; any external I/O is lifted into EvidencePlan, not performed during resolution.
1.1.2.3 Collision rules and disambiguation operators
Collisions occur when multiple atoms share identical human-facing identifiers (e.g., “Definition 2”) or when two GlobalAddr candidates match the same RelAddr under weak policies. Collision handling is expressed through explicit disambiguation operators:
@P: bind to a specific PathID segment (e.g., @C03 for Chapter 3),
@T: bind to a TileID or tile prefix,
@A: bind to AtomID (DEF/THM/ALG/CERT),
@L: bind to a lens/facet constraint.
Disambiguation is itself a composable calculus: operators commute only when independent; conflicting operators yield FAIL. For example, specifying a TileID incompatible with a PathID yields FAIL.
Collision rules:
under STRICT, any collision yields FAIL,
under WEAK, collision yields AMBIG with a ranked CandidateSet and the minimal disambiguation set required to collapse to a singleton.
1.1.2.4 Integrity constraints for address graphs
An address graph is a directed graph whose vertices are GlobalAddr and whose edges are typed references:[\mathcal G_{\text{addr}}=(V,E),\quad V={\mathrm{GlobalAddr}},\ E={(\mathrm{Src},\mathrm{Dst},\mathrm{Kind},\mathrm{Scope},\mathrm{Policy})}]Integrity constraints are mandatory invariants:
Well-formed vertices: every vertex is a valid GlobalAddrNF.
Referential integrity: every edge destination must exist in the index (unless explicitly deferred as EXTERNAL with PINNED fingerprint).
Scope legality: INTRA edges may not cross chapter boundary; INTER edges may not cross corpus boundary.
No hidden edges: every semantic dependency must be represented by an edge of appropriate Kind; unrepresented dependencies are treated as violations detected by audits.
Closure modes:
Strong closure: all INTRA and INTER references resolve (required for OK corridor),
Weak closure: unresolved references must be packaged as obligations (allowed for AMBIG/NEAR corridors).
1.1.3 Algorithms
1.1.3.1 Parser/validator for GlobalAddr strings
The parser is defined by a total grammar and produces a typed AST. Validation includes both syntactic and semantic checks.
Algorithmic stages:
Lex input string into tokens: CORPUS, optional EDITION, separators, path segments, tile literal, optional atom tag.
Parse tokens into structured fields; reject unknown separators, illegal digits, illegal atom tags.
Validate constraints:
CorpusID matches corpus registry,
EditionID matches semantic version syntax,
Path segments are within configured ranges,
TileID digits are base-4, length 4, explicitly bracketed,
AtomID is either absent or in the allowed enum.
Pseudocode:
function parse_global_addr(s):
t = lex(s)
ast = parse_tokens(t)
if not validate_ast(ast): return FAIL
return ast
Validator must be side-effect-free and must not consult external sources during strict validation; external registry lookup is only for verifying corpus existence and may be cached.
1.1.3.2 Canonicalizer (NF) for all address tokens
Canonicalization maps any valid address string to GlobalAddrNF and enforces uniqueness of representation.
Canonicalization steps:
Normalize casing and separators.
Pad numeric fields to fixed widths.
Normalize tile markers and digit string; reject any non-canonical tile syntax (e.g., 0000_4).
Normalize edition form (e.g., V1.2.3 → v1.2.3).
Normalize AtomID synonyms (e.g., DEFN → DEF if allowed; otherwise FAIL).
Pseudocode:
function canonicalize(ast):
ast.CorpusID = upper(ast.CorpusID)
ast.EditionID = normalize_semver(ast.EditionID)
ast.PathID = pad_path(ast.PathID)
ast.TileID = normalize_tile(ast.TileID)
ast.AtomID = normalize_atom(ast.AtomID)
return ast_to_string(ast)
Canonicalization must be idempotent: NF(NF(x)) = NF(x).
1.1.3.3 Retrieval index build and lookup complexity
The retrieval index is a set of maps enabling O(1) expected lookup for GlobalAddrNF and efficient partial resolution for RelAddr.
Index components:
MapExact: hash map GlobalAddrNF → AtomPayloadPointer.
MapPath: trie keyed by PathID segments.
MapTile: map from (ChapterID, TileID) → tile payload pointer.
MapAliases: map from allowed human aliases to CandidateSets (strictly bounded use; any alias must expand to explicit GlobalAddr reminders in outputs).
Index build algorithm:
Scan corpus registry for all atoms.
Parse and canonicalize each GlobalAddr; reject duplicates.
Insert into maps; compute auxiliary postings lists for partial queries.
Complexity:
Build: O(N) insertions with hashing; O(N log N) worst-case if sorting required for determinism.
Exact lookup: expected O(1).
Prefix path lookup: O(length(PathID)) for trie traversal.
Candidate generation for ambiguous refs: O(k) where k is postings list size for the alias or prefix; k must be bounded by policy or triggers AMBIG.
1.1.3.4 Export/import: address portability across corpora
Export packages a set of atoms and their reference closure into a portable bundle; import integrates bundles without violating uniqueness or closure constraints.
Export algorithm:
Choose a root set (R\subseteq V).
Compute closure under selected edge kinds (e.g., include all definitional dependencies, exclude optional citations by policy).
Emit:
atom payloads,
GlobalAddrNFs,
index tables,
a closure manifest listing unresolved EXTERNAL obligations with fingerprints.
Import algorithm:
Validate bundle schema and reminder of corpus constraints.
Check for GlobalAddr collisions:
if none, ingest directly,
if collisions exist, require explicit namespace remap rule (CORPUS prefix rewrite or EditionID branch import).
Rebuild local indices; verify closure constraints against manifest.
Portability guarantee: exported bundles must preserve GlobalAddrNFs; import may create a remapped view, but the original GlobalAddrNF remains available as an alias only under explicit mapping records.
1.1.4 Certificates
1.1.4.1 Address well-formedness cert suite
A well-formedness certificate is a machine-checkable artifact proving that all addresses in a target set satisfy grammar and semantic constraints.
Cert suite contents:
Grammar compliance: parser accepts and produces AST with all required fields.
NF compliance: canonicalizer returns identical string for all addresses already in NF.
Registry compliance: CorpusID is registered; PathID ranges are valid for declared chapters.
Tile compliance: base-4 digits and declared lens/facet mapping consistency.
Certificate format:
scope of certification (chapter, module, full corpus),
hash of the address list,
validator version and configuration hash,
pass/fail plus failure localization.
1.1.4.2 Uniqueness cert (no two atoms share an Addr)
Uniqueness is the invariant:[\forall a\neq b,\ \mathrm{GlobalAddrNF}(a)\neq \mathrm{GlobalAddrNF}(b)]Certificate construction:
Compute canonical GlobalAddrNF for all atoms.
Sort lexicographically (deterministic).
Verify strict inequality of adjacent elements; if violation, emit collision report containing both sources and required disambiguation operators.
Uniqueness is mandatory for OK corridor; if violated, the corpus is inconsistent and must be repaired before reminding any downstream claims.
1.1.4.3 Closure cert (all refs resolve)
Closure asserts that all references of selected kinds resolve under the applicable scope policy.
Let (E_{\text{req}}) be the set of required edges (by Kind and by corridor). Closure cert checks:
INTRA: must resolve to exactly one target within the chapter.
INTER: must resolve to exactly one target within the corpus.
EXTERNAL: must include a fingerprint and a retrieval policy; resolution may remain deferred but must be pinned.
Certificate output includes:
unresolved refs list (if any) with scope and policy,
proof that unresolved refs are permitted only under AMBIG/NEAR corridors and are tracked as obligations.
1.1.4.4 Regression cert (stable mapping across versions)
Regression cert ensures that address semantics remain stable across edition changes.
Given two editions (E_0, E_1), the certificate checks:
All GlobalAddrNFs in the stable set preserve referent identity (atom-level semantics) under declared migration rules.
Any moved content produces a MIGRATE record and a stable alias mapping if policy permits.
No silent reuse of a GlobalAddrNF for a different semantic atom.
Regression artifacts:
mapping table GlobalAddrNF(E0) → GlobalAddrNF(E1) (identity or explicit migrate),
changeset summary (additions/deletions),
proof that references in E0 continue to resolve under the mapping or are declared broken with a FAIL requirement.
1.2 Flower — Symmetry of the map
1.2.1 Objects
1.2.1.1 Lens labels and symmetry labels as metadata
Lens labeling assigns each tile a chart label in a fixed atlas:[\mathcal L={\text{Square},\text{Flower},\text{Cloud},\text{Fractal}}]and each tile carries:
LensLabel ∈ 𝓛,
FacetLabel ∈ {Objects, Calculus, Algorithms, Certificates},
SymmetryLabel (optional), declaring the relevant symmetry type for equivalence reasoning (e.g., “conjugacy”, “duality”, “gauge”, “parity”, “scale”).
SymmetryLabel is not decoration; it is a constraint on allowable transforms and on what constitutes invariance for that tile. Symmetry metadata is part of the GlobalAddr payload header and participates in certificate checks.
1.2.1.2 Adjacency relation on lens swaps
Legal lens movement is restricted to adjacent swaps in a fixed cyclic order:[\text{Square} \leftrightarrow \text{Flower} \leftrightarrow \text{Cloud} \leftrightarrow \text{Fractal} \leftrightarrow \text{Square}]The adjacency relation (Adj(\ell_1,\ell_2)) is true iff (\ell_1,\ell_2) are neighbors in this cycle.
This restriction enforces:
locality of semantic translation,
bounded defect accumulation,
deterministic factorization of any permutation into adjacent swaps.
Any attempted non-adjacent swap must be factorized into a sequence of adjacent swaps; direct non-adjacent transport is disallowed unless a dedicated certificate proves the composed path is equivalent and strictly lower defect than any adjacent factorization (rare; treated as a derived optimization, not a primitive).
1.2.1.3 “Dual” edge typing as symmetry operation
A DUAL is the primitive symmetry edge between representations of the same object across adjacent lenses. It is not a mere reference; it carries structured symmetry payload:
source atom,
target atom,
declared invariants preserved,
defect measure and corridor classification,
replay/witness pointers.
DUAL edges express “the same content seen through a neighboring chart.” They are used to:
transport definitions into calculi,
align algorithm implementations with proof obligations,
enable route compilation over the atlas.
DUAL is a symmetry operation on addresses: it maps one TileID into an adjacent-lens TileID while preserving PathID and facet alignment rules.
1.2.1.4 Commuting-diagram objects (square cells)
A commuting-diagram object is a structured artifact encoding a square of transforms:[A \xrightarrow{f} B,\quad A \xrightarrow{g} C,\quad B \xrightarrow{h} D,\quad C \xrightarrow{k} D]together with a commutation condition (h\circ f \approx k\circ g) under a declared defect metric (\Delta). Diagram objects are first-class atoms stored under GlobalAddr and referenced by certificates.
Diagram objects include:
the four node addresses,
the four edge identifiers,
defect definition (norm, divergence, or structural mismatch),
admissibility domains for each edge,
witness data enabling deterministic recomputation.
1.2.2 Calculus
1.2.2.1 Permutation actions on the atlas (legal reorderings)
The atlas supports permutation actions on lens labels, but legality is constrained by adjacency. A permutation (\pi) on (\mathcal L) is legal only if it is realized as a finite product of adjacent transpositions. The calculus defines:
generator set (S={(Square,Flower),(Flower,Cloud),(Cloud,Fractal),(Fractal,Square)}),
word representation of any legal reorder,
normal form for permutation words under braid-like reduction rules consistent with the adjacency cycle.
The action of a permutation on a tile is defined only when every intermediate swap is admissible for the specific object (domain constraints and corridor policies can block otherwise syntactically legal swaps).
1.2.2.2 Adjacent-swap factorization law
Any requested lens change from (\ell_a) to (\ell_b) must be factorized into an adjacent path:[\ell_a \to \ell_{a+1}\to \cdots \to \ell_b]in the cyclic order, with two possible directions (clockwise/counterclockwise). The factorization law chooses a canonical direction by:
minimizing a static cost function on lens steps (policy-defined),
if tied, choosing lexicographic order of lens labels,
if still tied, choosing the direction with historically lower observed defect for the object class.
This yields deterministic routing at the calculus level while remaining compatible with adaptive optimization via stored empirical costs (if allowed by policy and pinned).
1.2.2.3 Holonomy notion for multi-step rotations
Holonomy measures the net “twist” accumulated by traversing a closed loop of lens swaps and returning to the starting lens. Given a loop path (p) composed of DUAL edges, holonomy is defined as the defect of the induced endomorphism on the object:[\mathrm{Hol}(p) := \Delta(\mathrm{Id},\ \mathrm{Comp}(p))]where (\mathrm{Comp}(p)) is the composed transport along the loop and (\Delta) is the relevant defect metric for the object’s SymmetryLabel.
Holonomy is zero in ideal equivalence regimes; nonzero holonomy indicates:
hidden assumptions,
inconsistent branch choices,
approximations not tracked in residual ledgers,
or genuine obstructions.
Holonomy is therefore an integrity diagnostic for the atlas.
1.2.2.4 Defect of commutation (diagram mismatch)
For a diagram object, the commutation defect is:[\Delta := \mathrm{dist}(h\circ f,\ k\circ g)]where dist is chosen by corridor policy: operator norm, sup norm on a test suite, divergence on induced distributions, or structural mismatch count (for discrete objects).
The calculus defines how defects compose:
defects accumulate subadditively under composition,
defects may contract under dissipative steps,
defects may amplify under ill-conditioned inversions.
Defect calculus is used to classify claims into OK/NEAR/AMBIG/FAIL corridors and to choose among alternative routing factorizations.
1.2.3 Algorithms
1.2.3.1 Route normalization: reorder steps into canonical path
Route normalization takes an admissible lens route and rewrites it into a canonical adjacent-swap word.
Inputs:
start lens, target lens,
candidate route (possibly with redundant swaps),
policy config (costs, tie-breaks).
Outputs:
canonical route word,
composed defect bound,
required witnesses for each step.
Algorithm:
Reduce consecutive inverse swaps (cancelation).
Replace non-adjacent swaps by adjacent factorization.
Apply braid reductions consistent with the adjacency cycle to reach canonical normal form.
Recompute composed defect bound using defect calculus; if exceeds corridor budget, downgrade to AMBIG or FAIL with EvidencePlan.
1.2.3.2 Detect non-adjacent swaps and factor into adjacencies
Non-adjacent swap detection is performed by checking (Adj(\ell_i,\ell_{i+1})) for each transition. Any violation triggers factorization into either clockwise or counterclockwise adjacent path.
Pseudocode:
function factor_swap(a, b):
if Adj(a,b): return [a->b]
path1 = clockwise_adjacent_path(a,b)
path2 = counterclockwise_adjacent_path(a,b)
return choose_canonical(path1, path2)
The canonical choice is deterministic and uses policy-defined costs and tie-breaks. The resulting path is then validated stepwise for object admissibility.
1.2.3.3 Compute holonomy residual along loops
Holonomy computation is implemented as:
Identify loops in the graph induced by lens swaps (bounded depth by policy).
For each loop, compose the corresponding transports using replayable scripts.
Evaluate (\Delta(\mathrm{Id}, \mathrm{Comp}(p))) by a prescribed test suite or analytic bound.
Store holonomy reports as atoms addressable for auditing.
Loop enumeration must be bounded to prevent explosion; policy defines:
maximum loop length,
maximum number of loops per object class,
prioritization by edge density or by recent modifications.
1.2.3.4 Symmetry-aware caching of compiled routes
Compiled routes are cached as structured artifacts keyed by:
source GlobalAddrNF,
target lens,
corridor policy hash,
symmetry label,
replay harness version.
Cache entries include:
canonical route word,
witness pointers for each step,
composed defect bound,
validity window (edition/version constraints).
Cache invalidation is triggered by:
modification of any referenced atom,
changes in corridor policies,
changes in any witness or replay harness.
Caching is symmetry-aware: if a route is invariant under a declared symmetry, canonicalization collapses equivalent routes into a single cached artifact.
1.2.4 Certificates
1.2.4.1 Adjacency-only traversal cert
This certificate proves that every lens transition used in a route is adjacent. It includes:
route word explicitly listing each adjacent swap,
proof that (Adj(\ell_i,\ell_{i+1})) holds for all steps,
hash of the route artifact,
policy hash.
Violation yields FAIL; no downgrade is allowed because adjacency is a structural safety invariant.
1.2.4.2 Diagram-commutation cert (Δ≤ε)
A commutation certificate binds a diagram object to a defect bound (\Delta \le \varepsilon) under a specified metric and test suite.
Certificate includes:
diagram definition,
admissibility domains,
metric specification,
computed defect value and method (analytic bound or replay test),
the threshold (\varepsilon),
corridor mapping rule producing OK or NEAR.
The cert is OK-capable only if:
replay is deterministic,
the test suite is pinned,
all diagram edges are themselves certified or tracked as obligations.
1.2.4.3 Holonomy-boundedness cert
Holonomy-boundedness cert asserts that for a reminding family of loops (P), (\mathrm{Hol}(p)\le \eta) for all (p\in P), under pinned enumeration rules.
Certificate includes:
loop selection policy,
list of loops tested (by edge identifiers),
computed holonomy residuals,
maximum residual and its localization,
verdict mapping (OK if maximum is zero or within strict tolerance; NEAR otherwise with residual ledger).
Holonomy bound violations indicate atlas inconsistency and trigger quarantine audits.
1.2.4.4 Symmetry-preservation cert under refactors
When refactors change internal structure while attempting to preserve semantics, symmetry-preservation cert proves:
GlobalAddr stability (or explicit migrate records),
invariants preserved under declared symmetry label,
route caches remain valid or are invalidated deterministically.
This certificate links refactor commits to:
before/after atom sets,
mapping tables,
commuting diagram evidence for preserved transports.
1.3 Cloud — Extraction and search as first-class
1.3.1 Objects
1.3.1.1 CandidateSet datatype (ranked hypotheses)
A CandidateSet is a finite, ordered set of resolution hypotheses used when a reference cannot be uniquely resolved under policy. It is a structured object:[\mathrm{CandidateSet} := {(c_i,\ s_i,\ \rho_i)}_{i=1}^m]where:
(c_i) is a candidate GlobalAddrNF,
(s_i) is a deterministic score,
(\rho_i) is a justification record (features, constraints satisfied/violated).
CandidateSet is not permitted to hide uncertainty: it must carry explicit reasons for ranking and explicit disambiguation operators that would collapse the set to a singleton.
1.3.1.2 EvidencePlan datatype (what to compute next)
An EvidencePlan is a finite program of computations to resolve ambiguity or to upgrade NEAR to OK. It is represented as:[\mathrm{EvidencePlan} := (\mathrm{Queries},\ \mathrm{Computations},\ \mathrm{WitnessTargets},\ \mathrm{StopRules})]
Queries: deterministic retrieval prompts against the index.
Computations: replayable scripts (tests, bounds, comparisons).
WitnessTargets: which certificates or artifacts must be produced.
StopRules: criteria for termination, including abstention conditions.
EvidencePlan is mandatory whenever seen states are AMBIG; it prevents “open-ended uncertainty” by requiring a concrete path to closure or a declared impossibility.
1.3.1.3 Obligation lists and missingness tickets
An Obligation is a required unresolved item that blocks OK status. Obligations are structured as:[\mathrm{Obligation} := (\mathrm{RefNF},\ \mathrm{RequiredKind},\ \mathrm{DueCorridor},\ \mathrm{EvidencePlanID})]A missingness ticket is an obligation with an explicit scope (often EXTERNAL) and pinned retrieval conditions.
Obligation lists are stored per chapter and per module, enabling closure proofs to be constructed mechanically. Unresolved obligations are permitted only under NEAR/AMBIG corridors and must be counted and bounded.
1.3.1.4 Uncertainty ledger schema for retrieval
The uncertainty ledger records uncertainty and risk as first-class data attached to resolution and transport.
Ledger entries include:
reference identity (Src, Target candidates),
scope and policy,
ambiguity features (collision count, alias strength, hint mismatches),
confidence score mapped to corridor truth,
obligations issued,
quarantine flags.
Ledger is append-only and deterministic: given the same inputs and index state, it must emit identical entries.
1.3.2 Calculus
1.3.2.1 Scoring functions and priors for retrieval
Scoring is a deterministic function (S(\Gamma,r,c)) ranking a candidate (c) for reference (r) in context (\Gamma). Score is computed from pinned features:
path proximity score (same chapter/section preferred),
tile proximity score (same lens/facet preferred unless explicitly overridden),
kind compatibility score (e.g., DEF refs prefer DEF atoms),
version compatibility score,
explicit hint satisfaction score.
Priors are allowed only when pinned and explicitly declared; no implicit learned priors may influence deterministic resolution unless their parameters are recorded and hashed into the policy configuration.
1.3.2.2 Conditioning updates (new evidence → rerank)
When new evidence arrives (e.g., a disambiguation operator, a new certificate, a newly ingested module), CandidateSets must be updated by conditioning:[\mathrm{CandidateSet}' = \mathrm{Update}(\mathrm{CandidateSet}, \mathrm{Evidence})]Update rules:
add/remove candidates only if evidence changes feasibility constraints,
recompute scores deterministically,
emit a ledger delta recording the change and its justification.
Conditioning is monotone with respect to constraint satisfaction: evidence cannot increase feasibility for a candidate that violates a hard constraint.
1.3.2.3 Conflict aggregation and contradiction packets
Conflicts arise when:
two references claim mutually incompatible targets under strict policies,
two candidate sets overlap in a way that violates uniqueness or scope rules,
a ref resolves to a target that breaks declared invariants.
A contradiction packet is a structured artifact containing:
conflicting RefNFs,
minimal inconsistent subset (MIS) of constraints,
localized repair options (add disambiguation, migrate, rename, quarantine).
Conflict aggregation is deterministic and aims for minimality: the reported conflict set must be the smallest set of obligations whose satisfaction is impossible under current policies.
1.3.2.4 Confidence → corridor truth mapping
Confidence is mapped to corridor truth by a pinned thresholding function:
if uniqueness + closure + witness conditions hold: OK,
if unique but with bounded residuals/obligations: NEAR,
if multiple candidates remain with evidence plan: AMBIG,
if no candidate satisfies hard constraints or violates scope: FAIL.
The mapping function must be conservative: any untracked assumption forces downgrade. Confidence is never used to “promote” a claim absent witnesses; it only selects among candidates or assigns AMBIG/NEAR.
1.3.3 Algorithms
1.3.3.1 Deterministic search with tie-break rules
Deterministic search resolves RelAddr to TargetGlobalAddrNF or CandidateSet.
Algorithm:
Generate initial candidate pool using indexed postings by alias/path/tile hints.
Apply hard constraints: scope legality, corpus boundaries, edition constraints, atom-kind compatibility.
Score remaining candidates with deterministic (S).
Sort by score descending; apply stable tie-break:
lexicographic GlobalAddrNF,
smallest PathID,
smallest TileID,
earliest creation order (pinned registry order).
If top candidate is unique under strict margin condition, return singleton; else return CandidateSet with required disambiguations.
Pseudocode:
function resolve_ref(ctx, rel):
C = generate_candidates(ctx, rel)
C = filter_hard_constraints(C, rel)
if C empty: return FAIL
scored = [(c, score(ctx,rel,c)) for c in C]
ranked = stable_sort(scored)
if unique_top(ranked): return top(ranked)
return CandidateSet(ranked, required_disambiguations(ranked))
1.3.3.2 EvidencePlan compilation (queries → computations)
EvidencePlan compilation transforms ambiguity into a finite closure program.
Steps:
Identify minimal features causing ambiguity (path overlap, alias collision, missing atom kind).
Generate targeted index queries that separate candidates (e.g., demand a certificate presence, demand a specific kind).
Attach computations:
structural comparisons (tile/lens consistency),
diagram reminds for equivalence claims,
replay tests for suspected transports.
Generate stop rules:
stop when candidate set becomes singleton,
stop and abstain when evidence exceeds configured resource budget,
stop and quarantine when contradictions are detected.
EvidencePlan must be minimal: no redundant steps, each step must reduce candidate set or increase certainty monotonic.
1.3.3.3 Minimal witness set extraction
When a claim is promoted to OK or when an ambiguity is resolved, a minimal witness set (MWS) is extracted to support closure.
MWS extraction:
Build dependency subgraph induced by required reference kinds.
Compute minimal subgraph that:
contains the claim atom,
contains all definitional dependencies,
contains all certificates demanded by corridor policy.
Reduce by removing witnesses whose removal preserves closure (greedy pruning with replay checks).
Seal the resulting witness set as a certificate artifact with pointers.
This yields compact, portable proofs and prevents witness bloat.
1.3.3.4 Quarantine trigger detection
Quarantine triggers detect situations requiring escalation:
address collisions violating uniqueness,
unresolved STRICT references,
EXTERNAL references without fingerprints,
inconsistent CandidateSet conditioning (non-monotone feasibility),
holonomy anomalies exceeding bounds,
repeated oscillation between candidates across revisions.
Detection is executed as a deterministic audit pass over ledgers and obligations. Trigger output includes:
offending atoms,
minimal conflicting constraints,
recommended repair actions (rename, disambiguate, migrate, pin external, or split corpus).
1.3.4 Certificates
1.3.4.1 Deterministic ranking cert (no hidden randomness)
This certificate proves that ranking is reproducible and independent of runtime nondeterminism.
It contains:
policy hash (feature weights, thresholds, tie-break rules),
index snapshot hash,
input reference list hash,
output ranked CandidateSets,
proof of stable sorting keys.
Any use of randomness in candidate generation is prohibited unless the random seed is explicitly pinned and recorded; otherwise certification fails.
1.3.4.2 EvidencePlan completeness cert
Completeness cert proves that an EvidencePlan is sufficient to resolve ambiguity or to reach a justified abstention within declared budgets.
It includes:
ambiguity characterization,
required disambiguations and why they are sufficient,
bounded computational cost estimates for each step,
stop rules ensuring termination.
If no finite plan can guarantee resolution (e.g., external dependence), the cert must conclude with a formal abstention condition and a pinned external requirement.
1.3.4.3 Minimal witness set cert
MWS cert proves that the witness set attached to an OK claim is:
sufficient (replay closes all required obligations),
minimal with respect to a pinned minimality criterion (e.g., no proper subset closes).
The cert includes:
witness list,
closure transcript,
pruning transcript,
hashes of replay artifacts.
1.3.4.4 Quarantine compliance cert
This certificate proves that:
all quarantine triggers are detected under current audit policy,
all detected triggers produce explicit quarantine records,
no quarantined content is used to promote claims to OK without explicit override and additional evidence.
It includes:
audit configuration hash,
quarantined atom list,
blocked claim attempts list (if any),
remediation status records.
1.4 Fractal — Memory map as multiresolution
1.4.1 Objects
1.4.1.1 Resolution levels for outline → detail → code
The manuscript is organized as a multiresolution system with canonical resolution levels:
R0 (Outline): chapter/subchapter headings; addresses only; no proofs.
R1 (Definitions/Theorems): formal objects, statements, invariants; minimal algorithms.
R2 (Algorithms/Implementations): executable procedures, complexity bounds, reference closure.
R3 (Certificates/Replays): test suites, replay harnesses, proofs of correctness and stability.
Each tile stores a payload per resolution; higher resolutions must refine lower ones without contradicting them. Resolution identifiers are part of AtomID or payload metadata so that deterministic extraction can request exactly one level.
1.4.1.2 Compression seeds (store in, not out)
A compression seed is a compact representation that regenerates a target section deterministically under pinned rules. Seeds are not summaries; they are generators plus references to obligations and certificates.
Seed schema includes:
root GlobalAddr,
expansion recipe (ordered list of subaddresses to include),
required witnesses and corridors,
deterministic replay pointers for regeneration.
Seeds are stable across formatting changes and serve as the canonical memory objects for long-range recall, compilation, and routing.
1.4.1.3 Expansion operators (seed → sections)
An expansion operator is a deterministic function mapping a seed into a fully realized section payload at a specified resolution:[\mathrm{Expand}(Seed,\ Resolution,\ Policy)\to \mathrm{SectionPayload}]Expand must:
resolve and load all required atoms by GlobalAddrNF,
order them by canonical retrieval order,
apply policy-specific rendering rules (e.g., include proofs or omit them),
preserve explicit reference structure.
Expansion is required to be replayable: the same inputs yield identical output (byte-level) under fixed policy and index snapshot.
1.4.1.4 Cross-index (definitions/theorems/algorithms/tests)
The cross-index is a structured, multiresolution map enabling retrieval by semantic role rather than by position.
It contains:
DefIndex: all DEF atoms and their dependencies,
ThmIndex: all THM atoms with required lemmas,
AlgIndex: algorithm implementations and their required definitions,
TestIndex: certificates, replay scripts, and test suites.
Each index entry stores:
GlobalAddrNF,
resolution availability,
inbound/outbound reference counts,
corridor status and obligations.
Cross-index supports rapid extraction such as “all certificate obligations for Chapter 1” or “all algorithms depending on a given definition.”
1.4.2 Calculus
1.4.2.1 Coarse-grain and refine operations on the manuscript
Coarse-grain and refine are formal operations on the manuscript graph and payloads:
CoarseGrain: collapse a subgraph into a seed that preserves external interfaces (addresses, obligations, invariants).
Refine: expand a seed into explicit atoms at a higher resolution.
Constraints:
coarse-graining must preserve address graph interfaces (no broken refs),
refinement must introduce only new internal nodes or strengthen certificates, never alter external referents without explicit migration.
These operations define a controlled multiscale calculus for the manuscript itself, ensuring that memory mapping remains stable while detail increases.
1.4.2.2 Fixed points of extraction (stable summaries)
A fixed point of extraction is a seed that, when expanded and re-compressed under the same policy, yields itself:[\mathrm{Compress}(\mathrm{Expand}(Seed)) = Seed]Fixed points guarantee stability of memory artifacts under iterative editing and regeneration. The calculus defines conditions under which fixed points exist:
deterministic ordering,
canonical normal forms,
bounded aliasing,
stable corridor policies.
Fixed points are used as canonical “chapter kernels” for long-form manuscripts, enabling repeated refinement without drift.
1.4.2.3 Reference closure under refinement
Refinement must preserve closure properties. Let (R) be a resolution level. Refining from (R) to (R+1) is legal only if:
all required references at level (R) still resolve to the same targets at (R+1),
any new references introduced at (R+1) are either:
closed within the refined subgraph, or
added as explicit obligations.
This avoids “reference creep” where higher detail quietly pulls in untracked dependencies.
1.4.2.4 Budget algebra under scale changes
Budgets (time, compute, defect tolerance, proof depth) are managed algebraically under scale changes.
Budget rules:
CoarseGrain must not increase obligations; it may only convert explicit details into a seed with equivalent closure.
Refine may increase obligations but must increase them monotonically with explicit ledger entries and must remain within configured ceilings.
Corridor promotion (NEAR→OK) requires budget consumption tracked by witness production.
Budget algebra is part of policy; it must be pinned and included in certificates to prevent hidden resource-based drift.
1.4.3 Algorithms
1.4.3.1 Build the “quick-locate” index automatically
Quick-locate index is a deterministic map from common query intents to GlobalAddrNFs:
“definitions in this chapter,”
“algorithms in this section,”
“certificates required for OK closure,”
“unresolved obligations.”
Build algorithm:
Traverse all atoms in Chapter 1.
Classify each atom by role (DEF/THM/ALG/CERT) and lens/facet.
Compute dependency closure for each class.
Emit indices as address lists plus pointers to payloads.
The quick-locate index is included as a chapter-level artifact to facilitate human and machine extraction without scanning the full text.
1.4.3.2 Generate multi-scale tables of contents
Multi-scale TOC generation produces TOCs for R0–R3.
Algorithm:
Collect headings and addresses from R0 skeleton.
For each heading, check available resolutions and emit links to the highest available within the requested TOC level.
Attach counts of obligations and certificates for each subtree.
Emit deterministic ordering: by PathID then TileID then AtomID.
This TOC becomes a navigational instrument for both reading and automated tooling, ensuring stable location of content even as detail increases.
1.4.3.3 Proof-compression: prove in one chart, pull back
Proof-compression is a workflow:
Establish proof obligations in a chosen lens (often the one minimizing defect or maximizing algebraic simplicity).
Produce certificates and witnesses in that lens.
Transport the certified statements across DUAL routes into neighboring lenses via commuting diagrams and defect bounds.
Seal the transported results as addressable atoms with explicit witnesses.
This yields compact proof objects that avoid duplication across lenses while remaining auditably transported.
1.4.3.4 Delta-updates: patching without rewriting
Delta-updates allow revisions without reissuing the entire manuscript.
Patch protocol:
Identify changed atoms by GlobalAddrNF.
Emit a patch bundle with:
updated payloads,
updated references,
updated certificates or new obligations.
Recompute only affected index segments and regression certificates.
Preserve stable addresses; if semantics change, emit explicit migration records rather than reuse an address.
Delta-updates must be append-only: previous versions remain retrievable to preserve reproducibility of past claims.
1.4.4 Certificates
1.4.4.1 Expansion correctness cert (seed regenerates targets)
This certificate proves that expanding a seed yields the intended section payload under pinned policy:
seed hash,
policy hash,
index snapshot hash,
generated payload hash,
proof that all references in payload resolve identically to the seed’s declared interface.
It includes a replay script that regenerates the payload from the seed and re-verifies all closure conditions.
1.4.4.2 Index completeness cert
Index completeness cert proves that all atoms in the chapter are indexed in all mandated indices (MapExact, MapPath, MapTile, cross-indices). It includes:
atom inventory hash,
index inventory hashes,
proof of one-to-one coverage,
missingness report (must be empty for OK corridor).
1.4.4.3 Scale-stability cert (no drift across resolutions)
Scale-stability cert proves that refining or coarse-graining does not alter semantic referents:
GlobalAddrNF referents remain stable,
reference targets remain stable for required kinds,
any new obligations introduced are explicitly recorded and bounded.
It includes comparative hashes for R0–R3 expansions and a semantic mapping table.
1.4.4.4 Patch integrity cert (append-only deltas)
Patch integrity cert proves that a delta update:
does not alter prior sealed artifacts except by explicit version branching or migration records,

2.1.1 Objects
2.1.1.1 Presentation (\mathcal P=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0)) schema
A presentation is the atomic semantic unit used to encode a law, constraint, or specification as a typed satisfaction problem.
Definition 2.1 (Presentation). A presentation is a tuple[\mathcal P := (X,\ \Phi,\ \mathbb V,\ \mathbb V_0,\ \mathrm{Dom},\ \mathrm{Meta})]where:
(X) is a carrier (state space), equipped with declared structure (\mathrm{Str}(X)) (set, topological space, manifold, vector space, graph, measurable space, or product of these).
(\mathbb V) is a value space equipped with declared structure (\mathrm{Str}(\mathbb V)) compatible with evaluation and error measurement (at minimum: a set; typically: normed vector space, metric space, ordered space, lattice, or measurable space).
(\mathbb V_0 \subseteq \mathbb V) is the target set encoding the notion of “success.” Common cases include (\mathbb V_0={0}), an interval, a convex cone, a feasible polytope, a submanifold, a sigma-algebra constraint class, or a set of distributions.
(\Phi) is an evaluation map with declared type[\Phi:\mathrm{Dom}\to \mathbb V,]where (\mathrm{Dom}\subseteq X) is the admissible domain (see 2.1.1.4).
(\mathrm{Dom}\subseteq X) is the domain declaration, including boundary conditions, branch selections, and guard predicates ensuring (\Phi) is well-defined.
(\mathrm{Meta}) is a structured metadata record including: identifier, scope, dependencies, required certificates, evaluation mode (symbolic/numeric/hybrid), and a canonical normal form policy for this presentation.
A presentation is typed: the structures (\mathrm{Str}(X)) and (\mathrm{Str}(\mathbb V)) determine which compositions, transports, norms, measures, and solvers are admissible.
Definition 2.2 (Satisfaction). A state (x\in X) satisfies (\mathcal P), written (x\models\mathcal P), iff (x\in \mathrm{Dom}) and (\Phi(x)\in \mathbb V_0).
Definition 2.3 (Presentation equivalence, semantic level). Two presentations (\mathcal P,\mathcal Q) are semantically equivalent on a declared subset (S\subseteq X) if[\forall x\in S:\ (x\models\mathcal P) \Longleftrightarrow (x\models\mathcal Q),]with all domain guards enforced. Any algebraic rewrite that changes (\mathrm{Dom}) or introduces/removes singularities is not equivalence unless explicitly certified.
2.1.1.2 Satisfaction and validity subsets
A presentation induces canonical subsets of the carrier that separate well-definedness from feasibility.
Definition 2.4 (Validity set). The validity set of (\mathcal P) is[\mathrm{Valid}(\mathcal P) := \mathrm{Dom}\subseteq X,]the maximal set on which (\Phi) is declared well-defined under the guards.
Definition 2.5 (Satisfaction set). The satisfaction set is[\mathrm{Sat}(\mathcal P) := {x\in \mathrm{Dom}:\ \Phi(x)\in \mathbb V_0}.]
Definition 2.6 (Feasibility gap). The feasibility gap (as a set) is[\mathrm{Gap}(\mathcal P) := \mathrm{Valid}(\mathcal P)\setminus \mathrm{Sat}(\mathcal P).]
Definition 2.7 (Witnessed validity). When (\mathrm{Dom}) is specified by guards (g_i:X\to{\texttt{true},\texttt{false}}), define[\mathrm{Dom}=\bigcap_i g_i^{-1}(\texttt{true}),]and attach to each guard a certificate obligation (branch correctness, boundary compliance, or invertibility). A state (x) is witness-valid if all guard certificates required by policy are satisfied at (x).
Validity and satisfaction are kept separate to prevent silent “solves” that rely on undefined algebraic cancellations, illicit branch swaps, or boundary violations.
2.1.1.3 Residual definitions and norms
Residuals quantify deviation from satisfaction and serve as the bridge from feasibility to optimization and certification.
Definition 2.8 (Residual). A residual for (\mathcal P) is a function[\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P}:\mathrm{Dom}\to[0,\infty]]such that[\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P}(x)=0 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \Phi(x)\in \mathbb V_0,]and (\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}(x)>0) otherwise.
Residuals are derived from a distance-to-target construction.
Definition 2.9 (Distance-to-target residual). If ((\mathbb V,d)) is a metric space, define[\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P}(x):= d(\Phi(x),\mathbb V_0):=\inf{v_0\in\mathbb V_0} d(\Phi(x),v_0).]If (\mathbb V) is normed and (\mathbb V_0={0}), this reduces to (\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}(x)=|\Phi(x)|).
Definition 2.10 (Composite residuals). For combined constraints (\Phi=(\Phi_1,\ldots,\Phi_m)) with value space (\mathbb V=\prod_i \mathbb V_i) and target (\mathbb V_0=\prod_i \mathbb V_{0,i}), define a composite residual by a monotone aggregator (\mathcal A):[\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P}(x) := \mathcal A\big(\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P_1}(x),\ldots,\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P_m}(x)\big),]where admissible (\mathcal A) include: (\ell_p) norms, max, weighted sums, log-sum-exp, or barrier-augmented combinations, each pinned in (\mathrm{Meta}).
Residual design is part of the presentation: changing the residual changes the optimization geometry and must be explicit and certified if used for solver equivalence claims.
2.1.1.4 Domain/branch declarations as part of the object
The domain declaration (\mathrm{Dom}) is treated as an inseparable component of (\mathcal P).
Definition 2.11 (Domain declaration). A domain declaration is a tuple[\mathrm{Dom} := (\mathrm{Guard},\ \mathrm{Boundary},\ \mathrm{Branch},\ \mathrm{Regularity})]where:
(\mathrm{Guard}) is a finite set of predicates (g_i:X\to{\texttt{true},\texttt{false}}).
(\mathrm{Boundary}) encodes explicit boundary conditions (Dirichlet/Neumann constraints, inequality constraints, discrete admissibility, support constraints).
(\mathrm{Branch}) specifies branch selections for multivalued operations (log, root, inverse trig, arg, fractional power), including cut sets, principal branch, or explicit branch indices.
(\mathrm{Regularity}) states differentiability, measurability, or continuity assumptions required for calculus and solver compilation.
Definition 2.12 (Branch-consistent evaluation). A presentation is branch-consistent if for every multivalued subexpression, (\mathrm{Branch}) assigns a unique branch on (\mathrm{Dom}), and the induced (\Phi) is single-valued on (\mathrm{Dom}). If not, (\Phi) must be elevated to a set-valued map and the presentation must explicitly adopt set-valued semantics, which changes satisfaction and residual definitions.
Definition 2.13 (Guarded algebra). Any rewrite rule applied to (\Phi) must preserve (\mathrm{Dom}) or explicitly refine it by adding guards. Rewrites that expand (\mathrm{Dom}) are forbidden unless the added states are certified to preserve satisfaction equivalence.
2.1.2 Calculus
2.1.2.1 Equality as zero: ((F=G \Leftrightarrow H=F-G=0))
Equality constraints are normalized into zero constraints only under typed conditions.
Definition 2.14 (Equality presentation). Given typed maps (F,G:\mathrm{Dom}\to\mathbb W) into an abelian group ((\mathbb W,+)), define the equality presentation[\mathcal P_{=}:=(X,\ \Phi,\ \mathbb W,\ {0},\ \mathrm{Dom},\ \mathrm{Meta}),\quad \Phi:=F-G.]Then for all (x\in\mathrm{Dom}),[F(x)=G(x)\quad \Longleftrightarrow\quad \Phi(x)=0 \quad \Longleftrightarrow\quad x\models \mathcal P_{=}.]
If (\mathbb W) lacks a group structure (e.g., sets under inclusion, probability measures under divergence), equality is not rewritten as subtraction; instead, a typed difference or divergence must be declared (e.g., symmetric KL, Wasserstein, total variation), and the target set (\mathbb V_0) adjusted accordingly.
Definition 2.15 (Typed difference operator). A typed difference operator is a map (\Delta:\mathbb V\times\mathbb V\to\mathbb W) such that (\Delta(v,v)=0). Equality becomes (\Delta(F,G)=0). This keeps equality normalization valid across non-linear targets.
2.1.2.2 Multiway intersection vs cancellation zeros
Algebraic rewriting can introduce spurious solutions or hide invalidity. Two zero constructions are distinguished.
Definition 2.16 (Intersection zeros). For constraints (\Phi_i:\mathrm{Dom}\to\mathbb V_i) with targets (\mathbb V_{0,i}), the intersection satisfaction set is[\mathrm{Sat}{\cap}:=\bigcap_i {x\in\mathrm{Dom}:\ \Phi_i(x)\in \mathbb V{0,i}}.]
Definition 2.17 (Cancellation zeros). Let (\Phi:\mathrm{Dom}\to\mathbb V) and let (R) be a rewrite of (\Phi) (symbolic simplification, multiplication by a factor, division, squaring, exponentiation). The induced satisfaction set is[\mathrm{Sat}_R:={x\in\mathrm{Dom}_R:\ R(\Phi)(x)\in \mathbb V_0},]with (\mathrm{Dom}_R) the rewritten domain after added guards.
Cancellation zeros occur when (\mathrm{Sat}_R\supsetneq \mathrm{Sat}) due to loss of constraints (e.g., multiplying by zero, squaring removing sign, division by expression that can vanish).
Rule 2.18 (No silent cancellation). A rewrite (R) is admissible only if one of the following holds:
Guarded equivalence: (\mathrm{Dom}_R\subseteq\mathrm{Dom}) and (\mathrm{Sat}_R=\mathrm{Sat}\cap\mathrm{Dom}_R).
Certified equivalence: a certificate establishes (\mathrm{Sat}_R=\mathrm{Sat}) on a declared region of interest (S\subseteq X).
Refinement only: (\mathrm{Dom}_R\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}) and (\mathrm{Sat}_R\subseteq \mathrm{Sat}) (safe restriction).
This rule forces algebraic changes to be tracked as domain guards or certified equivalences; it prevents “solve-by-cancellation” artifacts.
2.1.2.3 Fixed-point structure as invariants under transport
Fixed points and invariant sets are formal invariants associated with operator presentations.
Definition 2.19 (Fixed-point presentation). For (f:\mathrm{Dom}\to X), define the fixed-point presentation[\mathcal P_{\mathrm{fix}}:=(X,\ \Phi,\ X,\ {0},\ \mathrm{Dom},\ \mathrm{Meta}),\quad \Phi(x):=f(x)-x,]when (X) is an abelian group (e.g., vector space). For general (X), fixed points are defined by equality predicate (f(x)=x) using typed equality (2.1.2.1).
Proposition 2.20 (Transport of fixed points under conjugacy). Let (T:X\to Y) be a bijection and define transported map (f^{(T)}:=T\circ f\circ T^{-1}). Then[\mathrm{Fix}(f^{(T)})=T(\mathrm{Fix}(f)).]If (T) is only partially defined, the statement holds on the admissible domain where both sides are defined and guards are satisfied.
Definition 2.21 (Invariant-set presentation). For a map (f) and a subset (S\subseteq X), the invariance constraint is (f(S)\subseteq S). Presentations encode invariance either by:
set inclusion constraints (typed), or
residual constraints measuring escape mass from (S) (metric/measure-based).
Transport preserves invariant sets when (T) is structure-preserving for the inclusion notion used (topological, measurable, algebraic), and when domain guards align.
2.1.2.4 Type checking for composed constraints
Presentations are composed to build structured specifications. Composition is governed by typed constructors.
Definition 2.22 (Conjunction / product presentation). Given presentations (\mathcal P_i=(X,\Phi_i,\mathbb V_i,\mathbb V_{0,i},\mathrm{Dom}_i,\mathrm{Meta}i)) on the same carrier (X), define[\bigwedge_i \mathcal P_i := \left(X,\ \Phi,\ \prod_i \mathbb V_i,\ \prod_i \mathbb V{0,i},\ \bigcap_i \mathrm{Dom}_i,\ \mathrm{Meta}\right),]with (\Phi(x):=(\Phi_1(x),\ldots,\Phi_m(x))) and (\mathrm{Meta}) combining dependencies and residual aggregator policy.
Definition 2.23 (Disjunction). Define (\bigvee_i \mathcal P_i) by satisfaction (\exists i:\ x\models\mathcal P_i). Disjunction requires explicit semantics for residual (e.g., (\min) of residuals) and is disallowed under strict corridors unless certified to avoid branch-induced ambiguity.
Definition 2.24 (Existential elimination / projection). For (X=Y\times Z), define (\exists z\ \mathcal P) as a presentation on (Y) where (y\models \exists z\ \mathcal P) iff (\exists z) such that ((y,z)\models\mathcal P). This constructor is admissible only when witness extraction is defined (algorithm + certificate requirements).
Rule 2.25 (Type checking). A composed presentation is well-typed only if:
carriers align or are explicitly producted,
value spaces are compatible with the chosen constructor,
domains intersect consistently (no contradictory guards),
residual aggregator is pinned and compatible with target product structure,
any quantifier constructors specify witness procedures and admissibility.
2.1.3 Algorithms
2.1.3.1 Normalization of constraints into canonical residual form
Normalization converts heterogeneous constraint statements (equalities, inequalities, inclusions, fixed points) into a canonical presentation with explicit residual and explicit guards.
Algorithm 2.26 (NormalizePresentation). Input: raw constraint object (\mathcal C) with carrier (X). Output: normalized presentation (\mathcal P) with:
explicit (\Phi:\mathrm{Dom}\to\mathbb V),
explicit (\mathbb V_0),
explicit residual policy.
Canonicalization steps:
Parse constraint forms into a typed AST: equality, inequality, inclusion, operator equation, fixed-point, measure constraint.
Select value space (\mathbb V) and target (\mathbb V_0) consistent with the constraint type.
Construct evaluation map (\Phi) using typed operators; forbid untyped subtraction/division.
Emit domain guards for every partial or multivalued operation; attach branch declarations.
Select residual as distance-to-target, with a pinned metric/norm.
Reject unsafe rewrites: any cancellation or domain expansion without guards/certificates.
Output Meta including dependency list and normal form identity.
Pseudocode:
function NormalizePresentation(C):
AST = parse_typed(C)
(V, V0) = choose_value_target(AST)
Phi = build_evaluation(AST, V)
Dom = build_domain_guards(AST)
Res = choose_residual(V, V0, policy)
if unsafe_rewrite_detected(AST): return FAIL
return Presentation(X, Phi, V, V0, Dom, Meta(policy, Res))
2.1.3.2 Constraint compilation into solver-ready templates
Compilation maps normalized presentations into solver templates (root finding, constrained optimization, feasibility, or probabilistic inference) without changing semantics.
Algorithm 2.27 (CompileToSolverTemplate). Input: normalized (\mathcal P). Output: a solver template (\mathcal T) with:
objective (J) or residual function for minimization,
constraint set for feasibility,
derivative/Jacobian specification if required,
domain enforcement hooks.
Templates:
Root-finding template (zero target): solve (\Phi(x)=0) on (\mathrm{Dom}).
Least-residual template: minimize (J(x)=|\Phi(x)|^2) or (J(x)=\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}(x)).
Inequality/barrier template: minimize residual with barrier terms ensuring guard satisfaction.
Feasibility template: find (x\in\mathrm{Dom}) such that (\Phi(x)\in\mathbb V_0), with projection operators if (\mathbb V_0) is convex.
Compilation emits a solver certificate interface requiring:
termination criteria expressed in residual bounds,
witness extraction (solution (x), residual ledger, domain checks),
reproducibility settings (tolerances, seeds if randomized).
2.1.3.3 Boundary/branch enforcement routines
Boundary and branch enforcement prevents undefined evaluation and ensures that solver steps remain in (\mathrm{Dom}).
Algorithm 2.28 (EnforceDomain). Input: current iterate (x), domain declaration (\mathrm{Dom}). Output: either:
valid (x'\in\mathrm{Dom}) (possibly projected), or
FAIL with violation certificate, or
AMBIG with evidence plan (if branch ambiguity arises and policy permits).
Routines:
Guard check: evaluate all predicates (g_i(x)).
Projection: if constraints are projectable (convex sets, simple bounds), project (x) to nearest feasible (x').
Branch selection: evaluate branch cut conditions; if ambiguous, select only if pinned; otherwise return AMBIG.
Boundary conditions: enforce equalities on boundary surfaces by constrained updates or penalty terms, consistent with compilation policy.
Branch enforcement is deterministic: branch choices are never made by numeric heuristics unless the choice rule is pinned and certified.
2.1.3.4 Residual evaluation pipelines (symbolic/numeric)
Residual evaluation is defined as a robust pipeline supporting symbolic simplification, numeric evaluation, and hybrid verification.
Algorithm 2.29 (EvaluateResidual). Input: (\mathcal P), state (x). Output: ((\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}(x),\ \mathrm{Aux})), where (\mathrm{Aux}) includes intermediate values and guard diagnostics.
Pipeline stages:
Guard stage: reject or project if (x\notin\mathrm{Dom}).
Evaluation stage:
symbolic: simplify (\Phi) under pinned assumptions and guards;
numeric: evaluate (\Phi(x)) using stable routines (compensated arithmetic where pinned);
hybrid: evaluate numerically and validate with interval bounds or exact arithmetic on subexpressions.
Target distance stage: compute (d(\Phi(x),\mathbb V_0)), possibly requiring projection onto (\mathbb V_0).
Diagnostics stage: compute local sensitivities (Jacobian norms, condition numbers) if required for stability certificates.
The pipeline emits deterministic transcripts suitable for replay-based certification.
2.1.4 Certificates
2.1.4.1 Well-typed presentation cert
A well-typed certificate establishes that (\mathcal P) is structurally valid:
(X,\mathbb V) structures are declared and compatible with (\Phi),
(\Phi:\mathrm{Dom}\to\mathbb V) is total on (\mathrm{Dom}),
(\mathbb V_0\subseteq \mathbb V) is well-formed,
constructors used in (\Phi) are type-correct (no untyped subtraction/division),
composition constructors (if any) satisfy Rule 2.25.
The certificate includes:
a typed AST of (\Phi),
domain guard list,
a proof of totality on (\mathrm{Dom}) (structural, plus guard coverage),
hash of the canonical normal form of (\mathcal P).
2.1.4.2 Domain admissibility cert
A domain admissibility certificate proves that the declared (\mathrm{Dom}) is consistent and non-empty under a pinned decision procedure.
Components:
guard satisfiability check (symbolic where possible, otherwise witness state),
boundary condition consistency check,
branch selection consistency check (no overlapping branch definitions on the same region unless set-valued semantics is declared),
regularity assumptions consistent with solver compilation.
If emptiness cannot be decided, the certificate must provide:
a witness for non-emptiness (a valid point), or
a formal AMBIG outcome with an evidence plan for deciding satisfiability.
2.1.4.3 Residual correctness cert (unit tests)
Residual correctness cert binds (\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}) to satisfaction semantics.
Required properties:
Soundness: if (x\models\mathcal P), then (\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}(x)=0).
Completeness (when required): if (\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}(x)=0), then (x\models\mathcal P).
Guard respect: residual evaluation rejects or projects outside (\mathrm{Dom}) according to policy; no undefined evaluation occurs.
Unit tests include:
positive cases (known satisfying points),
negative cases (violating points),
boundary cases (near branch cuts, constraints, or singularities),
randomized cases only if seeds are pinned.
2.1.4.4 Stability cert (small perturbation bounds)
Stability certificates quantify how residual changes under perturbations and how solver outputs depend on data.
Typical forms:
Lipschitz residual bound: for (x,y\in\mathrm{Dom}),[|\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P}(x)-\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P}(y)| \le L\cdot d_X(x,y),]with explicit constant (L) (global or local).
Condition bound: bounds on sensitivity of (\Phi) via Jacobian norms.
Robust satisfaction: if (\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}(x)\le \varepsilon) and condition bounds hold, then there exists (x^\star) near (x) such that (x^\star\models\mathcal P), with quantified radius.
Stability certs must specify:
domain region of validity,
norm choices,
how constants are computed or bounded (analytic or via verified numeric bounds),
replay transcript for verification.
2.2 Flower — Symmetries of presentations
2.2.1 Objects
2.2.1.1 Group actions on carriers and value spaces
Symmetry is encoded as group actions that preserve feasibility structure.
Definition 2.30 (Group action). A group (G) acts on (X) if there is a map (G\times X\to X), ((g,x)\mapsto g\cdot x), satisfying identity and associativity. Similarly, (G) acts on (\mathbb V) via a representation (\rho:G\to \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb V)).
Presentations carry symmetry data:[\mathrm{Sym}(\mathcal P):=(G,\ \cdot_X,\ \rho_{\mathbb V})]when symmetry is declared.
2.2.1.2 Equivariance data structures
Equivariance is the compatibility condition between actions and evaluation maps.
Definition 2.31 (Equivariance). (\Phi) is (G)-equivariant if for all (g\in G) and (x\in\mathrm{Dom}),[\Phi(g\cdot x)=\rho(g)\Phi(x),]with the additional requirement that (\mathrm{Dom}) is (G)-invariant: (g\cdot \mathrm{Dom}\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}).
Equivariance data structures include:
the group (G) (finite presentation or generator set),
action evaluators for (g\cdot x),
representation evaluators for (\rho(g)v),
a defect metric for approximate equivariance (2.2.2.2),
orbit sampling policies for certificates.
2.2.1.3 Orbit objects and quotient presentations
Symmetries induce quotient representations that reduce degrees of freedom and expose invariants.
Definition 2.32 (Orbit and quotient). The orbit of (x\in X) is (G\cdot x={g\cdot x:\ g\in G}). Define (X/G) as the set of orbits when the quotient exists as a set; additional structure (topological, smooth, measurable) requires further assumptions.
Definition 2.33 (Quotient presentation). When a quotient map (\pi:X\to X/G) exists and (\Phi) is equivariant, define a quotient evaluation map (\overline{\Phi}) on (X/G) by choosing a representative (x) of an orbit ([x]) and setting[\overline{\Phi}([x]) := \mathrm{Inv}(\Phi(x)),]where (\mathrm{Inv}) is a pinned invariantization operator (e.g., norm, spectrum, orbit-invariant features) yielding a well-defined value independent of the representative. Quotient satisfaction is defined by (\overline{\Phi}([x])\in \overline{\mathbb V}_0).
Quotient presentations trade explicit symmetry degrees for invariant observables, reducing redundancy while preserving feasibility semantics on orbits.
2.2.1.4 Gauge/choice objects (frames, representatives)
Many symmetries require a choice of representative rather than an intrinsic quotient.
Definition 2.34 (Gauge choice). A gauge choice is a map (s:X/G\to X) such that (\pi\circ s=\mathrm{id}) on its domain (a section), defined on a slice of the quotient when a global section does not exist.
Gauge objects include:
frame fields (basis choices),
phase conventions,
coordinate charts,
representative selection rules (e.g., normalize a vector, fix a phase, impose a constraint).
A gauge choice is valid only on the subset where it is well-defined and must be tracked as part of (\mathrm{Dom}) if it affects evaluation.
2.2.2 Calculus
2.2.2.1 Conjugacy-class invariants and observables
Symmetry yields invariants defined on conjugacy classes and orbits.
Definition 2.35 (Conjugacy invariants). For a group action on operators (e.g., (A\mapsto S^{-1}AS)), an observable (I) is conjugacy-invariant if[I(S^{-1}AS)=I(A).]Examples include spectrum, trace, determinant (when defined), singular values, Jordan type (in exact algebraic settings), and class functions derived from functional calculus.
For presentations, invariants are constructed as:
invariants of (\Phi(x)) under (\rho(g)),
invariants of solution sets under (g\cdot x),
invariants of residual distributions under orbit averaging.
Invariant selection is pinned in (\mathrm{Meta}) and determines what equivalences are admissible under symmetry reduction.
2.2.2.2 Symmetry obstructions as defects
Exact equivariance may fail; deviations are quantified and treated as defects.
Definition 2.36 (Equivariance defect). Given a metric (d_{\mathbb V}) on (\mathbb V), define[\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}(\Phi;g,x):=d_{\mathbb V}\big(\Phi(g\cdot x),\ \rho(g)\Phi(x)\big),]and the global defect on a set (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}) by[\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}(\Phi;S):=\sup_{g\in\mathcal G,\ x\in S}\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}(\Phi;g,x),]where (\mathcal G) is a pinned generating subset of (G) and (S) is a pinned test region or sample.
Symmetry obstruction is present when (\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}) is bounded below by a positive (\eta) under certified evaluation, indicating no gauge or normalization can eliminate the defect without changing the law.
2.2.2.3 Dual descriptions as symmetry-coherent transports
Dual descriptions relate different but symmetry-coherent presentations (e.g., primal/dual optimization, position/momentum, state/observable, Lagrangian/Hamiltonian).
Definition 2.37 (Symmetry-coherent duality). Presentations (\mathcal P) and (\mathcal Q) are symmetry-coherent duals if there exists an admissible transform (T) such that:
(T) transports carriers and value spaces (typed),
satisfaction is preserved on a declared region (S): (x\models\mathcal P \Leftrightarrow T(x)\models\mathcal Q),
the symmetry structures intertwine: (T(g\cdot x)=g'\cdot T(x)) for a mapped symmetry (G\to G'), and residuals transform with bounded distortion.
Duality is treated as a structured transport that must preserve invariants and explicitly record domain restrictions (branch/gauge effects).
2.2.2.4 Normal forms for symmetry-reduced laws
Symmetry reduction produces normal forms that quotient redundant degrees.
Normal forms include:
invariants-only presentations (orbit space),
gauge-fixed presentations (slice),
canonical representatives under group action (e.g., diagonal form under conjugacy when admissible).
Rule 2.38 (Reduction correctness). A reduced presentation (\mathcal P_{\mathrm{red}}) is correct for (\mathcal P) on region (S\subseteq X) if:
every satisfying orbit in (S) has a representative satisfying (\mathcal P_{\mathrm{red}}),
every satisfying point of (\mathcal P_{\mathrm{red}}) maps to a satisfying orbit of (\mathcal P),
gauge/quotient maps are admissible and certified on (S),
obstructions are explicitly excluded by guards or certified absent.
2.2.3 Algorithms
2.2.3.1 Equivariance check routines
Equivariance checking is performed against pinned generators and test sets.
Algorithm 2.39 (CheckEquivariance). Input: (\mathcal P) with symmetry data, generator set (\mathcal G\subseteq G), test set (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}). Output: defect bound (\Delta) and verdict.
Steps:
Verify domain invariance: for each (g\in\mathcal G), check (g\cdot S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}) (or project if permitted).
Evaluate (\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}(\Phi;g,x)) for all (g\in\mathcal G) and (x\in S).
Aggregate via sup or pinned robust aggregator (max or quantile bound with certified tail).
Emit (\Delta) and a transcript for certification.
Pseudocode:
function CheckEquivariance(P, Gens, S):
maxDef = 0
for g in Gens:
for x in S:
if not DomOK(P, x) or not DomOK(P, g•x): return FAIL
d = dist(Phi(g•x), rho(g)*Phi(x))
maxDef = max(maxDef, d)
return maxDef
2.2.3.2 Symmetry reduction / quotient compilation
Reduction compiles a presentation to an orbit-invariant or gauge-fixed form.
Algorithm 2.40 (CompileQuotientPresentation). Input: (\mathcal P) with equivariant (\Phi), invariantization operator (\mathrm{Inv}), quotient mechanism (\pi) or representative selection. Output: (\mathcal P_{\mathrm{red}}).
Steps:
Select reduction mode: quotient-invariant or gauge-fixed.
Build reduced carrier (Y) (either (X/G) or a slice subset (S\subseteq X)).
Define reduced evaluation:
quotient mode: (\overline{\Phi}([x])=\mathrm{Inv}(\Phi(x))),
slice mode: (\Phi_{\mathrm{slice}}(x)=\Phi(x)) with added gauge constraints.
Define reduced target and residual consistent with invariants.
Attach witness-extraction routines mapping reduced solutions back to original orbits.
Emit admissibility guards (exclude obstructions and singular slices).
2.2.3.3 Gauge-fixing and representative selection
Gauge fixing selects a unique representative per orbit on a domain where possible.
Algorithm 2.41 (GaugeFix). Input: (x\in X), gauge constraints (C(x)=0) defining a slice, and group action (g\cdot x). Output: (x_{\mathrm{gf}}) in the same orbit satisfying the gauge constraints.
Typical implementation:
solve for group element (g^\star) such that (C(g^\star\cdot x)=0),
set (x_{\mathrm{gf}}:=g^\star\cdot x).
The algorithm must:
declare existence/uniqueness conditions for (g^\star),
include fallback for non-uniqueness (AMBIG with candidate gauges) or non-existence (FAIL with obstruction).
2.2.3.4 Obstruction detection (defect lower bounds)
Obstructions are detected by certified lower bounds showing that no gauge or reduction can achieve equivariance or uniqueness.
Algorithm 2.42 (DetectObstruction). Input: presentation (\mathcal P), symmetry data, gauge constraints. Output: either:
a proof of feasible gauge region (invertibility bound), or
a lower bound (\eta>0) on equivariance defect or gauge inconsistency, certifying obstruction.
Mechanisms:
Jacobian rank deficiency in gauge equations,
nontrivial holonomy around loops (when a transport atlas is present),
topological nontriviality preventing global section,
certified failure of defect minimization below threshold.
2.2.4 Certificates
2.2.4.1 Equivariance cert ((\Delta\ge \eta) obstruction or (\Delta\le \varepsilon) success())
An equivariance certificate binds a presentation to one of two outcomes on a declared test regime:
Success: (\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}\le \varepsilon) under pinned metric and test regime.
Obstruction: (\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}\ge \eta>0) certified by a lower-bound method.
Certificates include:
group generator specification,
test regime specification (finite set or certified region),
metric specification,
computed defect bound and transcript,
domain invariance checks.
2.2.4.2 Gauge-fixing invertibility cert
This certificate proves that gauge fixing is locally (or globally on a region) invertible and yields unique representatives.
Typical form:
show that the map (g\mapsto C(g\cdot x)) has nonsingular Jacobian at (g^\star) on region (S),
provide a uniform invertibility bound ensuring uniqueness and stability.
Includes:
gauge constraints,
Jacobian computation method,
invertibility bound,
admissible region description.
2.2.4.3 Topological obstruction cert package
Topological obstruction certificates apply when no global gauge exists.
Package may include:
nontrivial bundle characteristic class evidence (in abstract form appropriate to the declared structure),
certified loop holonomy incompatibility,
proof that any global section violates continuity/measurability constraints.
The certificate must identify:
which global property fails,
the maximal region where local gauge remains admissible (if any),
the required domain guards to maintain correctness.
2.2.4.4 Symmetry-reduced correctness cert
This certificate proves that a reduced presentation (\mathcal P_{\mathrm{red}}) is correct for (\mathcal P) on a declared region, per Rule 2.38.
Includes:
mapping from reduced solutions to original solutions (witness lift),
mapping from original satisfying orbits to reduced satisfaction (projection),
proof of representative independence for invariants (quotient mode),
proof of uniqueness/stability for gauge (slice mode),
explicit domain guards excluding obstructions.
2.3 Cloud — Measures, ensembles, and probabilistic semantics
2.3.1 Objects
2.3.1.1 Measure/density objects on carriers
Probabilistic semantics extend presentations from pointwise satisfaction to distributional satisfaction.
Definition 2.43 (Probability carrier). A probabilistic carrier is ((X,\mathcal F)) a measurable space, together with a probability measure (\mu) or density (p) with respect to a reference measure.
Presentations may constrain:
moments,
support,
likelihood,
distributional distance to a target family.
Measure objects include:
(\mu) (probability measure),
(p) (density function),
empirical measure (\hat\mu),
parametric families ({\mu_\theta}).
2.3.1.2 Markov kernels / transition operators
Dynamic probabilistic constraints are represented by Markov kernels.
Definition 2.44 (Markov kernel). A Markov kernel (K) from (X) to (X) is (K:X\times\mathcal F\to[0,1]) such that (K(x,\cdot)) is a probability measure and (K(\cdot,A)) is measurable.
The induced operator on measures is:[\mu K(A)=\int_X K(x,A),d\mu(x).]Kernels and their generators encode stochastic evolution and are constrained by invariants such as stationarity and mixing rates.
2.3.1.3 Entropy and divergence functionals
Information functionals serve as residuals and targets for distributional constraints.
Definition 2.45 (Divergence residual). For a divergence (D(\mu|\nu)\ge 0) with (D(\mu|\nu)=0\iff \mu=\nu) (under declared conditions), define a presentation targeting a family (\mathcal M_0) of measures:[\Phi(\mu)=\inf_{\nu\in\mathcal M_0} D(\mu|\nu),\qquad \mathbb V_0={0}.]Entropy (H(\mu)), mutual information, and free energy can be used similarly with target sets specifying desired values or bounds.
All divergences used must be pinned (KL, reverse KL, JS, Wasserstein, TV, (\chi^2), Rényi), including domain requirements (absolute continuity, moment bounds).
2.3.1.4 Randomized readout maps and observables
Many constraints are imposed not directly on (X), but on observables.
Definition 2.46 (Randomized readout). A readout is a measurable map (R:X\times\Omega\to Y) with (\omega) random, inducing an observation distribution on (Y). Deterministic readouts are the special case without (\omega).
Observables include:
moments (\mathbb E_\mu[f(X)]),
event probabilities (\mu(A)),
empirical risk measures,
spectral statistics.
Presentations may constrain readout distributions, not the latent state directly; this introduces identifiability issues treated in 2.3.2.3.
2.3.2 Calculus
2.3.2.1 Pushforward/pullback of measures under transforms
Representation changes act on measures by pushforward and on densities by change of variables.
Definition 2.47 (Pushforward). For measurable (T:X\to Y) and measure (\mu) on (X), define (T_#\mu) by[(T_#\mu)(B)=\mu(T^{-1}(B)).]
Definition 2.48 (Pullback constraints). If a target constraint is specified on (Y) and a model lives on (X), constraints are pulled back by (T) via (T_#). This is the probabilistic analog of conjugacy transport for pointwise laws.
Residuals must account for distortion induced by (T) (Jacobian factors for densities, Lipschitz distortion for Wasserstein metrics, divergence distortion for KL-like functionals).
2.3.2.2 Conditioning as corridor restriction
Conditioning is treated as a structural restriction analogous to domain guards.
Definition 2.49 (Conditioned presentation). Given event (E\in\mathcal F) with (\mu(E)>0), define conditioned measure (\mu(\cdot|E)). Conditioning updates satisfaction criteria and residuals:
constraints are evaluated on (\mu(\cdot|E)),
validity requires (\mu(E)>0) and measurability.
Conditioning is therefore a corridor restriction: the admissible distributional domain is restricted to measures that assign positive mass to (E), and any inference using conditioning must carry this as a domain guard.
2.3.2.3 Identifiability vs aliasing boundaries
Identifiability determines whether constraints on observables determine latent states.
Definition 2.50 (Identifiability). A parametrized family ({\mu_\theta}) is identifiable under observation map (R) if[\mathcal L(R(X;\theta_1))=\mathcal L(R(X;\theta_2)) \Rightarrow \theta_1=\theta_2,]under declared equivalence (e.g., up to symmetry). Aliasing occurs when distinct parameters yield identical observation laws.
Identifiability is treated as a boundary condition of the semantics: when absent, claims must be AMBIG with explicit CandidateSet or evidence plan; point-estimate claims are forbidden under strict policies.
2.3.2.4 Error propagation across operator pipelines
Operator pipelines (kernels, transforms, readouts) propagate uncertainty.
Given a pipeline (\mu \xrightarrow{K} \mu' \xrightarrow{T} \nu \xrightarrow{R} \eta), residuals and divergences transform with distortion bounds. The calculus records:
contractivity of kernels in chosen metrics,
Lipschitz properties of transforms,
concentration bounds for estimators.
Error propagation is formalized as bounds of the form:[D(\eta,\eta_0)\ \le\ \mathcal B\big(D(\mu,\mu_0),\ \delta_K,\ \delta_T,\ \delta_R\big),]where (\delta_\cdot) are operator-specific defect or approximation terms, each pinned and ledgered.
2.3.3 Algorithms
2.3.3.1 Sampling / estimation routines tied to presentations
Sampling converts distributional presentations into computable estimators.
Algorithm 2.51 (EstimateResidualFromSamples). Input: presentation (\mathcal P) defined on measures, sample generator for (\mu), sample size (n). Output: estimated residual (\widehat{\mathrm{Res}}) and confidence data.
Steps:
Generate samples (x_1,\ldots,x_n) with pinned random seed policy.
Compute empirical estimators of required quantities (moments, probabilities, divergences).
Compute (\widehat{\mathrm{Res}}) by plugging estimators into residual definitions.
Attach concentration bounds and diagnostics (effective sample size, autocorrelation for Markov chains).
Sampling routines are presentation-aware: the estimator structure is determined by (\Phi), (\mathbb V_0), and residual policy.
2.3.3.2 Uncertainty propagation engine (ledger)
Uncertainty propagation emits structured bounds through pipelines and iterated transforms.
Algorithm 2.52 (PropagateUncertaintyLedger). Input: initial uncertainty record, operator pipeline specs (kernels/transforms/readouts), defect models, desired metric. Output: ledger entries at each stage plus end-to-end bound.
The engine:
composes contraction or distortion bounds,
incorporates estimator variance and bias,
flags identifiability failures,
outputs obligations when bounds require missing certificates (e.g., mixing rate cert).
2.3.3.3 Likelihood-to-residual compilation
Likelihood-based inference is normalized into residual minimization consistent with presentation semantics.
Given data (y) and model (p_\theta(y)), define negative log-likelihood:[\Phi(\theta):= -\log p_\theta(y) - c,]with target (\mathbb V_0={0}) when normalized by the optimum constant (c), or use a target interval specifying acceptable likelihood ratio bounds.
Algorithm 2.53 (CompileLikelihoodToResidual).
Parse likelihood specification and domain constraints on (\theta).
Define evaluation map (\Phi(\theta)=-\log p_\theta(y)) and admissible domain (positivity, normalization).
Choose residual as (\Phi(\theta)-\inf_{\theta}\Phi(\theta)) when the infimum is computable or approximable with certificate obligations; otherwise use direct (\Phi) with a target bound.
Emit solver template and required certificates (identifiability, curvature bounds, mixing bounds if MCMC is used).
2.3.3.4 Robust estimators and adversarial checks
Robustness is treated as an explicit algorithmic guard against model misspecification and adversarial contamination.
Algorithm 2.54 (RobustResidualEvaluation).
evaluate residual under multiple estimators (median-of-means, trimmed estimators),
compute discrepancy between estimators as a robustness diagnostic,
test for adversarial signatures (outlier rates, heavy tails, distribution shift),
if robustness diagnostics exceed policy thresholds, emit AMBIG with evidence plan or FAIL if constraints are violated.
Robustness checks are pinned and replayable; they are not heuristic add-ons.
2.3.4 Certificates
2.3.4.1 Positivity/mass-preservation certs
Certifies that:
measures remain probability measures under the pipeline,
kernels preserve total mass and positivity,
densities remain nonnegative and integrable under transforms,
numerical approximations do not violate mass constraints beyond pinned tolerances.
Includes analytic proofs or replayable tests (e.g., quadrature bounds, stochastic matrix row-sum checks).
2.3.4.2 Concentration/mixing-rate certs
For sampling and Markov evolution, certifies:
concentration bounds for estimators (Hoeffding/Bernstein/sub-Gaussian/sub-exponential assumptions pinned),
mixing rate bounds for Markov chains (spectral gap, drift/minorization, coupling bounds),
effective sample size computations consistent with mixing cert.
If such bounds are unavailable, the certificate must downgrade to AMBIG with an evidence plan specifying which additional diagnostics or assumptions are required.
2.3.4.3 Identifiability cert (or AMBIG evidence plan)
Provides either:
identifiability proof (possibly modulo symmetry), or
a certified aliasing statement (explicit equivalence classes), or
an AMBIG evidence plan specifying additional observables or interventions needed to identify parameters.
The cert must be explicit about the equivalence relation used and the region of parameter space where identifiability holds.
2.3.4.4 Propagation-bound certs
Certifies end-to-end error bounds across an operator pipeline:[D(\text{output},\text{target}) \le \text{bound}(\text{inputs}, \text{defects}, \text{estimation error}),]with:
pinned metric/divergence,
pinned operator distortion constants,
explicit ledger of approximation terms,
replay transcript for numeric bound evaluation.
2.4 Fractal — Filtrations, multiresolution presentations
2.4.1 Objects
2.4.1.1 Scale ladders and filtrations
Multiresolution semantics are represented by filtrations on carriers and information structures.
Definition 2.55 (Filtration). A filtration is a nested family ((\mathcal F_\epsilon)_{\epsilon\in\mathcal E}) of sigma-algebras on (X) (probabilistic case) or nested partitions / subspaces (deterministic/discrete case), indexed by a scale parameter (\epsilon) in an ordered set (\mathcal E).
Filtrations encode what is observable at each scale and define coarse-graining maps.
2.4.1.2 Coarse variables and observability sets
A coarse variable is a map (C_\epsilon:X\to Y_\epsilon) measurable with respect to (\mathcal F_\epsilon), capturing the information retained at scale (\epsilon).
Observability sets:
(\mathrm{Obs}_\epsilon\subseteq \mathrm{Func}(X)): functions measurable at scale (\epsilon),
(\mathrm{Unobs}_\epsilon): components eliminated by coarse-graining.
Presentations at scale (\epsilon) constrain only observables in (\mathrm{Obs}_\epsilon), requiring explicit handling of hidden degrees.
2.4.1.3 RG maps on states/parameters
Renormalization maps formalize how presentations transform across scales.
Definition 2.56 (RG map). An RG map consists of:
a coarse-graining transform (R_\epsilon:X\to X_\epsilon),
a parameter map (\mathcal R_\epsilon:\Theta\to\Theta),
an induced evaluation (\Phi_\epsilon) such that the coarse presentation (\mathcal P_\epsilon) approximates the original (\mathcal P) in the observables retained.
RG maps are typed and include admissibility and contraction data as part of their objects.
2.4.1.4 Fixed-point data objects (exponents, directions)
Fixed points organize universality classes.
Definition 2.57 (RG fixed point). (\theta^\star) is an RG fixed point if (\mathcal R_\epsilon(\theta^\star)=\theta^\star) for the RG step. Fixed-point data objects include:
(\theta^\star),
linearization (D\mathcal R_\epsilon(\theta^\star)),
eigenvalues/eigendirections (relevant/irrelevant),
critical exponents and scaling laws.
These objects are addressable and referenced by multiscale certificates and algorithms.
2.4.2 Calculus
2.4.2.1 Universality as equivalence under coarse-grain maps
Universality is encoded as equivalence of presentations under coarse-graining.
Definition 2.58 (Universality equivalence). Two presentations (\mathcal P,\mathcal Q) are universal-equivalent on scale ladder (\mathcal E) if for every (\epsilon\in\mathcal E), their coarse projections (\mathcal P_\epsilon,\mathcal Q_\epsilon) are equivalent on observables (\mathrm{Obs}_\epsilon) within pinned defect bounds.
Universality equivalence is weaker than pointwise equivalence and is explicitly scale-indexed; it is admissible only when scale-dependent corridors and budgets are declared.
2.4.2.2 Relevant/irrelevant decomposition
Linearization around fixed points yields a decomposition of perturbations.
Definition 2.59 (Relevant/irrelevant). Let (L=D\mathcal R(\theta^\star)). A perturbation direction (v) is:
relevant if (|\lambda|>1) for eigenvalue (\lambda) associated with (v),
irrelevant if (|\lambda|<1),
marginal if (|\lambda|=1) (requires higher-order analysis).
This decomposition governs which parameters must be tracked at each scale and which can be compressed into residual budgets.
2.4.2.3 Stability/contractivity conditions
Multiscale methods rely on contraction properties in appropriate metrics.
Definition 2.60 (Contractive RG). An RG step is contractive on a region (S) if there exists (0<\kappa<1) such that[d(\mathcal R(\theta_1),\mathcal R(\theta_2))\le \kappa, d(\theta_1,\theta_2)]for all (\theta_1,\theta_2\in S), in a pinned metric (d). Contractivity supports convergence to fixed points and enables NEAR→OK upgrades when defect decays geometrically.
2.4.2.4 Scale-dependent corridors and budgets
Corridors and budgets are indexed by scale:
admissibility domain (\mathrm{Dom}_\epsilon),
residual tolerance (\varepsilon_\epsilon),
certificate requirements (\mathcal C_\epsilon).
Budget rules:
coarse levels may permit larger residuals and fewer certificates,
refinement tightens budgets and increases certificate obligations,
any promotion in corridor truth requires consistency across scales.
Scale-dependent budgets prevent inconsistent claims where a statement is “true” at one scale but silently used as exact at another.
2.4.3 Algorithms
2.4.3.1 Build restriction/prolongation pairs
Restriction and prolongation connect fine and coarse spaces.
Algorithm 2.61 (BuildRP). Input: fine carrier (X_h), coarse carrier (X_H), discretization data. Output: restriction (R:X_h\to X_H) and prolongation (P:X_H\to X_h) with pinned consistency goals.
Construction options:
averaging/projection restriction,
injection restriction (subsampling),
interpolation prolongation,
basis-based prolongation (wavelets/multiresolution).
The pair must declare the consistency target (RP\approx I) or (PR\approx I) in a pinned norm, which becomes a certificate obligation (2.4.4.1).
2.4.3.2 Multigrid/RG step compilation
Multigrid and RG steps are compiled as structured operators acting on residual problems.
Algorithm 2.62 (CompileMultiscaleStep).
Given (\mathcal P_h) at fine level, build coarse presentation (\mathcal P_H) by restriction of observables and parameters.
Define smoother operator (S_h) reducing high-frequency residual components.
Define coarse correction (C_h := P\circ \text{Solve}(\mathcal P_H)\circ R).
Compose step (x\mapsto C_h(S_h(x))) with pinned order.
Attach defect estimator and contraction monitoring.
Compilation yields a replayable multiscale script with explicit stage boundaries and diagnostics.
2.4.3.3 Fixed-point finding and defect tracking
Fixed points are found by iterative application of RG or multiscale maps with defect controls.
Algorithm 2.63 (FindFixedPointWithDefect).
iterate (\theta_{k+1}=\mathcal R(\theta_k)),
compute defect (e_k=d(\theta_{k+1},\theta_k)) or residual in a pinned norm,
stop when (e_k\le \tau) and auxiliary certificate conditions hold (contractivity, domain invariance),
if (e_k) stagnates or increases, emit AMBIG with evidence plan or FAIL if domain guards break.
Defect tracking is scale-aware: defects must decrease in the relevant metric for the declared corridor to upgrade.
2.4.3.4 Adaptive refinement from residual estimators
Adaptive refinement increases resolution only where needed.
Algorithm 2.64 (AdaptiveRefine).
Evaluate residual and local error indicators (\eta_i) (element-wise or region-wise).
Select refinement set (I={i:\eta_i>\theta}) by pinned thresholding.
Refine carrier (X) locally (mesh refinement, basis enrichment, partition refinement).
Update restriction/prolongation operators and presentations (\mathcal P).
Recompute certificates impacted by refinement (RP≈I, stability, contraction) or issue obligations.
Adaptive refinement is deterministic under pinned selection rules and emits a ledger of refinement decisions for replay.
2.4.4 Certificates
2.4.4.1 (RP\approx I) consistency certs
Certifies that restriction/prolongation pairs preserve coarse information when embedded back into fine space.
Typical forms:[|R P - I_{X_H}| \le \varepsilon,\qquad |P R - \Pi| \le \varepsilon]with (\Pi) a pinned projector onto the representable subspace. The certificate specifies norms, regions, and how operator norms are computed or bounded.
2.4.4.2 Contraction certs for recursion steps
Certifies geometric decay of defects under multiscale steps:[e_{k+1}\le \kappa e_k,\qquad 0<\kappa<1,]in a pinned metric and on a pinned admissible region, including domain invariance checks and robustness to numerical approximation.
2.4.4.3 Universality certs (shared fixed point)
Certifies that two presentations share a universality class by:
identifying a common fixed point (or fixed manifold),
matching relevant exponents and invariant observables within tolerances,
providing scale-indexed equivalence bounds on observables.
The cert must be explicit about:
which observables define equivalence,
which scales are covered,
which defects are permitted and how they are bounded.
2.4.4.4 Adaptive refinement correctness certs
Certifies that adaptive refinement does not alter semantics outside refined regions beyond declared tolerances and that refinement decisions are replayable.
Includes:
refinement decision transcript,
proof of determinism under pinned rules,
stability checks across refinement boundary,
updated closure and certificate obligations.
CHAPTER 2 — SEMANTIC UNITS: PRESENTATIONS, CARRIERS, RESIDUALS (Addr ⟨0001⟩₄)
Chapter 3 — Rotation Calculus: Conjugacy, Groupoids, Normal Forms (Addr ⟨0002⟩₄)
3.1 Square — Conjugacy transport as computation
3.1.1 Objects
3.1.1.1 Admissible transforms: domains + branches + inverses
A rotation is implemented as an admissible transform (T) between carriers, together with the data required to make transport well-defined, single-valued, and replayable.
Definition 3.1 (Transform object). A transform object is a tuple[T := (X,\ Y,\ T_\rightarrow,\ T_\leftarrow,\ \mathrm{Dom}_T,\ \mathrm{Cod}_T,\ \mathrm{Branch}_T,\ \mathrm{Reg}_T,\ \mathrm{Meta}_T)]where:
(X) and (Y) are carriers with declared structures.
(T_\rightarrow:\mathrm{Dom}_T\to Y) is the forward map.
(T_\leftarrow:\mathrm{Cod}_T\to X) is the inverse map (right and left inverse conditions enforced on declared domains).
(\mathrm{Dom}_T\subseteq X) and (\mathrm{Cod}_T\subseteq Y) are admissible domains for forward/inverse evaluation.
(\mathrm{Branch}T) is a branch declaration for any multivalued primitives appearing in (T\rightarrow) or (T_\leftarrow), including cut sets and principal branch rules.
(\mathrm{Reg}_T) declares regularity requirements (measurable/continuous/(C^k)/diffeomorphic) as needed for transport of measures, derivatives, spectra, or topological invariants.
(\mathrm{Meta}_T) pins canonical forms, evaluation modes, and obligations (e.g., monotonicity, Jacobian nondegeneracy, Lipschitz constants) required for certification.
Definition 3.2 (Admissibility). A transform (T) is admissible for a presentation (\mathcal P=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0,\mathrm{Dom}{\mathcal P},\mathrm{Meta}{\mathcal P})) when:
(\mathrm{Dom}_{\mathcal P}\cap \mathrm{Dom}T\neq\emptyset) and the intended working domain (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}{\mathcal P}\cap\mathrm{Dom}_T) is declared.
(T_\rightarrow(S)\subseteq \mathrm{Cod}T) and (T\leftarrow(T_\rightarrow(S))=S).
All branch constraints are compatible on (S) (single-valuedness is guaranteed).
The regularity declared in (\mathrm{Reg}_T) meets the needs of the transport (e.g., invertible Jacobian almost everywhere for density transport; continuity for topological invariants; (C^1) for Jacobian-based Lipschitz bounds).
Admissibility is a semantic constraint: if (T) is not admissible on a region, no rotation claim on that region is permitted.
3.1.1.2 Carriers and typed operator families
Rotation calculus acts on typed operator families over carriers.
Definition 3.3 (Operator family). An operator family over a carrier (X) is specified by:[\mathcal F(X) := (\mathrm{OpType},\ \mathrm{DomOp},\ \mathrm{CodOp},\ \mathcal A,\ \mathrm{Meta})]where (\mathrm{OpType}) declares a class (map (X\to X), map (X\to \mathbb V), differential operator, integral operator, kernel/Markov operator, functional, constraint map), and (\mathcal A) is an operator algebra or typed composition system used to form composites.
Definition 3.4 (Typed composition). If (f:\mathrm{Dom}_f\to Y) and (g:\mathrm{Dom}_g\to Z) are operators with (Y\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}g), the composite (g\circ f) is admissible on[\mathrm{Dom}{g\circ f} := {x\in \mathrm{Dom}_f:\ f(x)\in \mathrm{Dom}_g}.]All rotation compositions are evaluated using this domain rule; no implicit extension of domains is allowed.
Typed operator families include:
deterministic maps and flows,
constraint/evaluation maps (\Phi) in presentations,
solution operators (solvers) treated as algorithms with obligations,
probabilistic kernels and pushforward maps (see 3.3),
multiscale restriction/prolongation and RG maps (see 3.4).
3.1.1.3 Residual metrics for “same law” claims
Equivalence of laws under rotation is not asserted; it is measured and certified using residual metrics.
Definition 3.5 (Law-equivalence defect). Let (\mathcal P=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0,\mathrm{Dom}{\mathcal P},\mathrm{Meta})) and (\mathcal Q=(Y,\Psi,\mathbb W,\mathbb W_0,\mathrm{Dom}{\mathcal Q},\mathrm{Meta}')) be presentations, and let (T:X\leftrightarrow Y) be a transform admissible on a declared region (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}{\mathcal P}\cap \mathrm{Dom}T). Define the defect of equivalence under (T) by[\Delta{T}(\mathcal P,\mathcal Q;S) := \sup{x\in S} d_{\ast}\Big(\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P}(x),\ \mathrm{Res}{\mathcal Q}(T_\rightarrow(x))\Big),]where (d_{\ast}) is a pinned metric on ([0,\infty]) (typically absolute difference) and residuals are pinned in each presentation.
If residuals are vector-valued, define defect by a pinned aggregator:[\Delta_{T} := \sup_{x\in S}\ \Big|\mathrm{ResVec}{\mathcal P}(x)-\mathrm{ResVec}{\mathcal Q}(T_\rightarrow(x))\Big|_{\mathrm{agg}}.]
Definition 3.6 (Satisfaction-set transport defect). When residuals are unavailable or insufficient, define set-level defect using a pinned set distance (e.g., Hausdorff distance in a metric space):[\Delta^{\mathrm{Sat}}{T}(\mathcal P,\mathcal Q;S) := d{\mathrm{set}}\Big(T_\rightarrow(\mathrm{Sat}(\mathcal P)\cap S),\ \mathrm{Sat}(\mathcal Q)\cap T_\rightarrow(S)\Big).]
Defect metrics are always accompanied by:
a declared domain (S),
a declared evaluation method (analytic bound or replayable test suite),
an explicit mapping into corridor truth (OK/NEAR/AMBIG/FAIL).
3.1.1.4 Canonical normal forms for equations under rotation
A rotation-ready representation requires canonical normal forms that expose:
domains and branches,
typed operator structure,
residual semantics,
admissible transport boundaries.
Definition 3.7 (Presentation Normal Form, PNF). A presentation is in PNF when:
(\Phi) is represented as a typed AST built from pinned primitives.
(\mathrm{Dom}) is explicitly given as guards + boundary + branch declarations (no implicit assumptions).
(\mathbb V_0) is explicit and compatible with the declared metric/norm used by residuals.
The residual (\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}) is explicitly defined as distance-to-target with a pinned metric.
Definition 3.8 (Rotation Normal Form, RNF). A presentation is in RNF when, in addition to PNF:
all occurrences of transformable “coordinates” appear only through declared coordinate maps,
all multivalued primitives carry explicit branch tags,
the presentation is annotated with a minimal set of admissible transforms (T) (or transform families) that are permitted to act on it, including required certificates.
Rule 3.9 (No cancellation without guards). Any algebraic simplification that can change validity or satisfaction sets is forbidden unless it refines the domain by guards or is accompanied by a certificate proving equality of satisfaction on the declared region.
3.1.2 Calculus
3.1.2.1 Conjugacy rule (\big(f^{(T)}=T^{-1}fT\big)) as primitive
Rotation calculus is built on conjugacy transport as the primitive operation.
Definition 3.10 (Conjugacy transport of operators). Let (T:X\leftrightarrow Y) be an admissible transform, and let (f:\mathrm{Dom}f\to \mathrm{Cod}f\subseteq X) be an operator on (X). The transported operator on (Y) is[f^{(T)} := T\rightarrow\circ f\circ T\leftarrow,]with domain[\mathrm{Dom}_{f^{(T)}} := {y\in \mathrm{Cod}T:\ T\leftarrow(y)\in \mathrm{Dom}f\ \land\ f(T\leftarrow(y))\in \mathrm{Dom}_T}.]
This definition is typed and domain-aware; transport is undefined outside (\mathrm{Dom}_{f^{(T)}}).
Definition 3.11 (Transport of presentations). Let (\mathcal P=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0,\mathrm{Dom}{\mathcal P},\mathrm{Meta})) and (T:X\leftrightarrow Y) admissible on (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}{\mathcal P}\cap \mathrm{Dom}_T). The transported presentation on (Y) is[\mathcal P^{(T)} := \big(Y,\ \Phi^{(T)},\ \mathbb V,\ \mathbb V_0,\ \mathrm{Dom}^{(T)},\ \mathrm{Meta}^{(T)}\big)]where:
(\Phi^{(T)}(y) := \Phi(T_\leftarrow(y))),
(\mathrm{Dom}^{(T)} := T_\rightarrow(\mathrm{Dom}_{\mathcal P}\cap \mathrm{Dom}_T)\cap \mathrm{Cod}_T) with induced branch/guard declarations,
(\mathrm{Meta}^{(T)}) records transform identity, corridor policies, and required certificates for validity.
Transport preserves the value space and target semantics; it relocates constraints from (X) to (Y) via (T_\leftarrow).
3.1.2.2 Transport of solution sets and fixed points
Conjugacy yields exact transport of satisfaction and fixed-point structure on admissible regions.
Proposition 3.12 (Transport of satisfaction sets). Let (T) be admissible on (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}{\mathcal P}\cap\mathrm{Dom}T). Then:[x\in S\ \land\ x\models \mathcal P \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad T\rightarrow(x)\models \mathcal P^{(T)}.]Moreover,[T\rightarrow\big(\mathrm{Sat}(\mathcal P)\cap S\big) = \mathrm{Sat}(\mathcal P^{(T)})\cap T_\rightarrow(S).]
Proposition 3.13 (Transport of fixed points). If (f:X\to X) is an operator and (f^{(T)}) is defined on (Y), then on admissible domains:[y\in \mathrm{Fix}(f^{(T)}) \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad T_\leftarrow(y)\in \mathrm{Fix}(f),]and hence (\mathrm{Fix}(f^{(T)}) = T_\rightarrow(\mathrm{Fix}(f)\cap \mathrm{Dom}_T)) with domain restrictions enforced.
Transport of invariant sets, periodic orbits, and conserved quantities follows the same rule, provided the invariants are expressed in a transportable form (either as constraints on (\Phi) or as invariants of (f) under conjugacy).
3.1.2.3 Composition of rotations (associativity and domains)
Rotation compositions form a partial algebra governed by domain compatibility.
Definition 3.14 (Transform composition). If (T_1:X\leftrightarrow Y) and (T_2:Y\leftrightarrow Z) are transforms, define their composition (T_2\circ T_1:X\leftrightarrow Z) by:[(T_2\circ T_1)\rightarrow := T{2,\rightarrow}\circ T_{1,\rightarrow},\qquad (T_2\circ T_1)\leftarrow := T{1,\leftarrow}\circ T_{2,\leftarrow},]with admissible domains restricted to points where both compositions are defined and branch declarations are consistent.
Proposition 3.15 (Associativity on admissible intersections). For composable transforms (T_1,T_2,T_3), the composition is associative on the maximal domain where all evaluations are defined:[(T_3\circ T_2)\circ T_1 = T_3\circ (T_2\circ T_1).]
Proposition 3.16 (Compatibility with operator transport). For any operator (f) on (X) and composable (T_1:T(X\to Y)), (T_2:(Y\to Z)),[f^{(T_2\circ T_1)} = \big(f^{(T_1)}\big)^{(T_2)}]on the shared admissible domain.
This establishes that rotation chains can be reduced to a single composed transform when only semantic transport is concerned; implementation may still retain intermediate steps for certification, defect tracking, and corridor enforcement.
3.1.2.4 Defect of approximate commutation
Approximate commutation is formalized by commutator defects and diagram defects.
Definition 3.17 (Diagram defect). Given two composable paths from (A) to (D):[A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{h} D,\qquad A \xrightarrow{g} C \xrightarrow{k} D,]define the diagram defect on a test set (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}A) by[\Delta{\square}(S) := \sup_{x\in S} d_D\big((h\circ f)(x),\ (k\circ g)(x)\big),]where (d_D) is a pinned metric on (D).
Definition 3.18 (Commutator defect). For endomorphisms (u,v) on (X), define[\Delta_{[u,v]}(S) := \sup_{x\in S} d_X\big((u\circ v)(x),\ (v\circ u)(x)\big).]
Definition 3.19 (Approximate conjugacy defect). For an operator (f) on (X), an operator (g) on (Y), and transform (T:X\leftrightarrow Y), define[\Delta_{\mathrm{conj}}(f,g;T,S) := \sup_{x\in S} d_Y\big(T_\rightarrow(f(x)),\ g(T_\rightarrow(x))\big),]with (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}_f\cap\mathrm{Dom}_T) pinned.
Rule 3.20 (Defect propagation). Defects compose subadditively under path concatenation:[\Delta_{\square}(S)\ \le\ \Delta_{\square_1}(S)+\Delta_{\square_2}(S')]whenever the second square is evaluated on the image (S') of the first path, with distortion constants (Lipschitz bounds) explicitly included when metrics differ or when maps are not isometries.
Defects are mapped into corridor truth:
OK when defect is provably zero on the declared region or below a strict tolerance with exact domain/branch closure;
NEAR when defect is bounded by (\varepsilon) with residual ledger and stability constraints;
AMBIG when defect cannot be bounded due to missing certificates or ambiguous branches;
FAIL when the best certified lower bound exceeds acceptable thresholds or domains cannot be made admissible.
3.1.3 Algorithms
3.1.3.1 Normalize an equation into rotation-ready form
Normalization produces PNF/RNF representations suitable for rotation, composition, and certification.
Algorithm 3.21 (NormalizeToRNF). Input: a raw equation/specification (\mathcal C) on carrier (X). Output: a presentation (\mathcal P) in RNF.
Steps:
Parse (\mathcal C) into a typed AST with explicit operator types.

3.1.3.2 Compile a rotation chain into a replayable script
A rotation chain is compiled into a deterministic transcript that can be replayed to verify correctness and compute defects.
Definition 3.22 (Rotation chain). A rotation chain is a finite sequence[\mathbf T := (T_1,\ldots,T_n)]where each (T_i) is a transform (X_{i-1}\leftrightarrow X_i) and adjacent composition is admissible on a declared working set.
Algorithm 3.23 (CompileRotationChain). Input: a chain (\mathbf T), a presentation (\mathcal P) on (X_0), and corridor policy. Output: a replay script (\mathcal S) that:
verifies admissibility at each step,
transports (\mathcal P) or transported operators as required,
emits domain/branch checks and residual ledgers.
Script structure:
Initialize context with ((\mathcal P, x_0\text{ or test set }S_0)).
For (i=1) to (n):
verify (S_{i-1}\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}_{T_i}),
compute (S_i = T_{i,\rightarrow}(S_{i-1})),
verify branch declarations and inverse consistency on (S_{i-1}),
record distortion constants (Lipschitz/Jacobian bounds if required).
Produce transported presentation (\mathcal P^{(\mathbf T)}) on (X_n) (or transported operator family) with explicit induced domains.
Seal transcript: hashes, policy hash, transform identities, and obligations.
3.1.3.3 Compute defect metrics along the chain
Defect computation is stagewise and compositional, producing both local and global bounds.
Algorithm 3.24 (ComputeChainDefects). Input: chain script (\mathcal S), defect metrics pinned by policy, and test regime ({S_i}). Output: defect ledger.
Components:
Local conjugacy defects: for each step, compute (\Delta_{\mathrm{conj}}(f_i,g_i;T_i,S_{i-1})) where applicable.
Diagram defects: for each declared commuting square in the chain, compute (\Delta_{\square}(S)).
Round-trip defects: compute (\Delta_{\mathrm{rt}}(T_i,S_{i-1})) (see 3.1.4.4).
Aggregation:
propagate defects using subadditivity and distortion constants,
maintain a final bound (\Delta_{\mathrm{global}}) for the chain,
emit AMBIG if any required constant/certificate is missing,
emit FAIL if any hard domain/branch condition is violated.
3.1.3.4 Canonicalize chains (same effect, one normal route)
Chain canonicalization reduces different rotation chains to a single normal route when they are semantically equivalent under pinned rules.
Definition 3.25 (Chain equivalence under policy). Two chains (\mathbf T,\mathbf U) from (X) to (Y) are equivalent on region (S) if:
both are admissible on (S),
their composed transforms agree on (S): ((\mathbf T)\rightarrow(x)=(\mathbf U)\rightarrow(x)) for all (x\in S), or are equal within a pinned tolerance under a pinned metric,
they satisfy the same branch declarations and domain guards on (S) (or differences are certified as harmless).
Algorithm 3.26 (CanonicalizeChain).
Cancel adjacent inverse pairs (T\circ T^{-1}) when certified on the working set.
Factor any non-adjacent lens swaps into adjacent swaps when operating within the atlas restrictions.
Reduce via pinned rewrite rules on transform words (only those certified to preserve semantics under domain guards).
Evaluate cost and defect bounds for remaining candidates and select the canonical representative by:
minimal global defect bound,
then minimal policy cost,
then lexicographic order of transform identifiers.
Canonicalization outputs:
canonical chain (\mathbf T^\star),
proof that (\mathbf T\sim \mathbf T^\star) under policy (or AMBIG with evidence plan),
updated replay script and defect ledger.
3.1.4 Certificates
3.1.4.1 Conjugacy correctness certs (unit tests)
A conjugacy correctness certificate binds an implementation of transported operators/presentations to the mathematical definition.
Required checks (pinned test regime (S)):
Forward-inverse consistency:[\sup_{x\in S} d_X\big(T_\leftarrow(T_\rightarrow(x)),x\big)\le \varepsilon_{\mathrm{inv}}.]
Transport correctness (operator form): for each pinned test operator (f),[\sup_{x\in S} d_Y\big(f^{(T)}(T_\rightarrow(x)),\ T_\rightarrow(f(x))\big)\le \varepsilon_{\mathrm{conj}}.]
Transport correctness (presentation form):[\sup_{x\in S} \big|\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P}(x)-\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P^{(T)}}(T_\rightarrow(x))\big|\le \varepsilon_{\mathrm{res}}.]
Certificate includes:
transform identities, branch declarations, and domains,
test regime specification,
metrics and tolerances,
replay transcript and hashes.
3.1.4.2 Domain/branch safety certs
Domain/branch safety certifies that (T_\rightarrow) and (T_\leftarrow) are well-defined, single-valued, and consistent on the declared region.
Requirements:
Domain admissibility: (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}T) and (T\rightarrow(S)\subseteq \mathrm{Cod}_T).
Branch consistency: all branch predicates select a unique branch on (S); no branch cut crossings occur within certified neighborhoods.
Nondegeneracy (when required): Jacobian determinant bounds or monotonicity bounds ensuring local invertibility on (S).
Guard closure: composing the transforms with the presentation’s guards preserves validity (no hidden invalid evaluations).
3.1.4.3 Defect bound certs (NEAR)
A defect bound certificate upgrades an approximate transport/equivalence to NEAR by providing a rigorous bound.
Contents:
defect definition (diagram, commutator, conjugacy defect),
test regime or analytic region,
bounding method (analytic inequality, verified numeric bounds, interval arithmetic, or pinned exhaustive test suite),
final bound (\Delta\le \varepsilon),
ledger of approximation terms and stability conditions under which the bound remains valid.
Any missing prerequisite certificate forces AMBIG; any certified lower bound exceeding threshold forces FAIL.
3.1.4.4 Round-trip integrity certs (rotate/back)
Round-trip integrity certifies that rotating forward and back returns identity within tolerance on a declared region:[\Delta_{\mathrm{rt}}(T,S) := \sup_{x\in S} d_X\big(T_\leftarrow(T_\rightarrow(x)),x\big)\le \varepsilon_{\mathrm{rt}},]and optionally the reverse direction on (S' = T_\rightarrow(S)):[\sup_{y\in S'} d_Y\big(T_\rightarrow(T_\leftarrow(y)),y\big)\le \varepsilon'_{\mathrm{rt}}.]
This certificate is mandatory for treating a transform as a reversible rotation under strict corridors; otherwise the transform is treated as a lossy map and must be managed as such (often in Cloud/Fractal contexts).
3.2 Flower — Rotation groupoids and commuting diagrams
3.2.1 Objects
3.2.1.1 Groupoid of presentations (objects/1-morphisms)
Rotations between presentations form a groupoid: composition is partial and inverses exist only on admissible regions with certified branch/domain control.
Definition 3.27 (Rotation groupoid). Define a groupoid (\mathsf{Rot}) where:
Objects are RNF presentations (\mathcal P) (including carrier, evaluation, target, domain, residual, metadata).
A 1-morphism (\alpha:\mathcal P\to\mathcal Q) is a record[\alpha := (T,\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{Region},\ \mathrm{Inv},\ \mathrm{DefectSpec},\ \mathrm{WitnessPtr},\ \mathrm{ReplayPtr})]such that (T) is admissible on (\mathrm{Region}\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}_{\mathcal P}), (\mathcal Q) is (or is certified equivalent to) (\mathcal P^{(T)}) on (\mathrm{Region}), and the defect specification maps the claim into corridor truth.
Identity morphisms are given by identity transforms on each object with zero defect. Inverses exist when a round-trip integrity certificate holds on the working region and branch data is symmetric.
3.2.1.2 Symmetry actions and equivariance data
Symmetry acts as structure on the groupoid: it constrains which morphisms preserve invariants and which morphisms represent gauge changes.
A symmetry package attached to an object (\mathcal P) specifies:
group (G) acting on the carrier (X) and value space (\mathbb V),
equivariance conditions for (\Phi) and invariance of (\mathrm{Dom}),
defect metrics for approximate symmetry,
admissible gauge transformations as special morphisms in (\mathsf{Rot}).
Equivariance data is incorporated into morphisms by requiring that transforms intertwine actions:[T_\rightarrow(g\cdot x) = g'\cdot T_\rightarrow(x),]where the mapped action (g\mapsto g') is pinned (often (G'=G)).
3.2.1.3 Duality objects (basis swaps, gauge swaps)
A duality object is a distinguished class of morphisms representing a change in representation that preserves semantics but changes primitives.
Dualities include:
basis swaps (coordinate changes in vector spaces, Fourier-like swaps, diagonalizations),
gauge swaps (choice of representative in an equivalence class),
primal/dual formulations (constraint ↔ Lagrange multipliers),
state/observable pictures (where applicable).
Duality morphisms carry additional obligations:
invariants that must match across dual forms,
lattice or integrality constraints when discrete structures must be preserved,
unitary/symplectic preservation when an inner product or symplectic form is pinned.
3.2.1.4 Holonomy objects for multi-step loops
Loops in (\mathsf{Rot}) encode accumulated twist from multi-step rotations.
Definition 3.28 (Holonomy record). A holonomy record for a loop (\gamma:\mathcal P\to\mathcal P) is:[\mathrm{Hol}(\gamma) := (\gamma,\ \Delta_\gamma,\ \mathrm{Region},\ \mathrm{InvDeviation},\ \mathrm{WitnessPtr},\ \mathrm{ReplayPtr})]where (\Delta_\gamma) is the defect of the composed morphism relative to identity on (\mathrm{Region}), and (\mathrm{InvDeviation}) records any invariant drift along the loop.
Holonomy objects are addressable atoms used for integrity audits and for diagnosing obstructions.
3.2.2 Calculus
3.2.2.1 Commuting squares as proof obligations
Commuting squares are the primary proof obligations for equivalence of alternative factorization paths.
Definition 3.29 (Commuting square obligation). Given morphisms in (\mathsf{Rot}):[\mathcal P \xrightarrow{\alpha} \mathcal Q,\quad \mathcal P \xrightarrow{\beta} \mathcal R,\quad \mathcal Q \xrightarrow{\gamma} \mathcal S,\quad \mathcal R \xrightarrow{\delta} \mathcal S,]the square commutes on region (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}_{\mathcal P}) if[(\gamma\circ \alpha)\ \equiv\ (\delta\circ \beta)]as morphisms, meaning their induced transports agree on (S) (exactly or within pinned defect), and they preserve the same invariants and branch/domain declarations.
Commuting squares are mandatory whenever the manuscript asserts two derivations are “the same law” or when route canonicalization collapses distinct chains into a normal route.
3.2.2.2 Obstructions as nonzero commutator defects
Obstructions are formal, certified failures of commutation that cannot be eliminated by allowable gauge changes or domain refinements.
Definition 3.30 (Obstruction). Given a class of allowable adjustments (\mathcal G) (gauge transforms, branch refinements, or permitted counterterms), define the minimal achievable defect:[\Delta^\star := \inf_{g\in \mathcal G}\ \Delta_{\square}(S;g).]An obstruction exists on (S) if a certificate proves (\Delta^\star \ge \eta > 0).
Obstructions are recorded as FAIL-capable artifacts with explicit localization: which invariants break, which branch/gauge choices fail, and what minimal changes would be required to restore commutation (if any).
3.2.2.3 Lattice-preservation for discrete duality groups
When carriers include discrete lattices (integer lattices, grids, combinatorial complexes), duality maps must preserve integrality.
Definition 3.31 (Lattice-preserving transform). Let (L\subseteq X) be a distinguished lattice (e.g., (\mathbb Z^n\subseteq \mathbb R^n)). A transform (T:X\to X) is lattice-preserving on (L) if:[T(L)\subseteq L\quad \text{and}\quad T^{-1}(L)\subseteq L]on the declared region. In linear settings, this reduces to (T\in \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb Z)) (determinant (\pm 1)).
Lattice-preservation is treated as a hard constraint: violation forces FAIL for any claim that depends on integrality (e.g., discrete spectra, combinatorial invariants, exact cycle structure).
3.2.2.4 Normal forms for symmetry-coherent rotations
Symmetries induce equivalence classes of morphisms; a normal form chooses canonical representatives.
Definition 3.32 (Symmetry quotient of morphisms). Given a symmetry group action on morphisms (via pre/post composition by gauge morphisms), define equivalence:[\alpha \sim \alpha' \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \exists g,h\in \mathcal G:\ \alpha' = h\circ \alpha\circ g.]
Rule 3.33 (Symmetry-coherent normal form). A canonical representative (\mathrm{NF}(\alpha)) is selected by:
enforcing a pinned gauge-fixing convention (basis/phase/frame),
minimizing defect within the symmetry class (when optimization is allowed and replayable),
then applying deterministic lexical tie-break on transform identifiers and branch tags.
Normal forms ensure that the manuscript’s transport routes are stable under refactors and that equivalences are representable by a unique canonical arrow wherever possible.
3.2.3 Algorithms
3.2.3.1 Build commuting-diagram checkers
A commuting-diagram checker constructs and verifies commutation obligations.
Algorithm 3.34 (CheckCommutingSquare). Input: a square of morphisms ((\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)), region (S), defect metric. Output: commutation defect and verdict.
Steps:
Validate admissibility: ensure all compositions are defined on (S).
Compute the two transports:
path A: (\gamma\circ\alpha),
path B: (\delta\circ\beta).
Evaluate (\Delta_{\square}(S)) using:
analytic bounds when available, otherwise
pinned test suite evaluation with deterministic sampling.
Verify invariant preservation and branch/domain consistency for both paths.
Emit certificate artifacts or obligations based on corridor policy.
3.2.3.2 Compute holonomy residuals
Holonomy residuals are computed for selected loops to diagnose drift and obstructions.
Algorithm 3.35 (ComputeHolonomy). Input: loop (\gamma=\alpha_n\circ\cdots\circ\alpha_1) at object (\mathcal P), region (S). Output: (\Delta_\gamma) and invariant drift.
Steps:
Compile loop script via chain compilation.
Compute round-trip defect relative to identity on (S).
Evaluate drift in pinned invariants (e.g., residuals, conserved quantities, discrete labels).
Emit holonomy record and trigger quarantine if drift exceeds thresholds.
Loop enumeration policy is pinned (maximum length, maximum count, prioritization rules) to ensure determinism and bounded compute.
3.2.3.3 Detect “false unitarity” in basis changes
Basis changes that appear symmetry-preserving can silently violate inner-product structure when implemented numerically or when domain restrictions are ignored.
Algorithm 3.36 (DetectFalseUnitarity). Input: a purported unitary/orthogonal transform (U), inner product specification, region (S). Output: unitarity defect and verdict.
Checks:
Structural check: verify (U) is declared to preserve inner product and that domains/branches are compatible.
Numeric check (when applicable): evaluate[\Delta_U := |U^\ast U - I| \quad \text{and/or}\quad \sup_{x\in S} \big| \langle Ux,Uy\rangle - \langle x,y\rangle \big|]with pinned norms/test pairs.
Lattice compatibility check if a discrete lattice is pinned.
Emit FAIL if defect exceeds tolerance; emit NEAR if bounded with ledger; otherwise OK.
3.2.3.4 Gauge-coherent basis selection
Gauge-coherent basis selection chooses conventions that stabilize defect metrics and enable canonicalization.
Algorithm 3.37 (SelectGaugeCoherentBasis). Input: object (\mathcal P), symmetry data, candidate basis families, defect objective. Output: pinned basis/gauge choice.
Steps:
Enumerate admissible gauges (finite set) or define a deterministic optimization problem (if continuous).
Enforce constraints: domain validity, branch consistency, integrality constraints.
Compute defect objective (commutation, holonomy, conjugacy defect) under each gauge.
Select canonical gauge by minimal defect then deterministic tie-break.
Emit gauge-fixing record and update morphisms to symmetry-normal form.
3.2.4 Certificates
3.2.4.1 Diagram commutation certs
A diagram commutation certificate asserts:[\Delta_{\square}(S)\le \varepsilon,]with:
pinned region (S),
pinned metric and evaluation method,
branch/domain consistency verified on both paths,
invariant drift bounded or zero.
The certificate is OK-capable only if all participating morphisms and prerequisites are themselves certified or recorded as obligations under an allowed corridor.
3.2.4.2 Symmetry preservation certs
Symmetry preservation certifies that a morphism (\alpha:\mathcal P\to\mathcal Q) intertwines symmetry actions and preserves declared invariants.
Requirements:
domain invariance under group action on the working region,
equivariance defect bound (or obstruction lower bound),
invariants preserved exactly or within pinned tolerance.
3.2.4.3 Lattice-preservation certs
A lattice-preservation certificate verifies that a transform preserves pinned discrete structures:
integrality ((T(L)\subseteq L)),
invertibility on (L),
determinant/invariant checks in linear settings,
branch/domain restrictions that ensure the discrete structure is not crossed into invalid regions.
Violation is FAIL under any corridor that depends on discrete invariants.
3.2.4.4 Holonomy-boundedness certs
Holonomy-boundedness certifies that for a pinned family of loops (\Gamma) and region (S),[\sup_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\ \mathrm{Hol}(\gamma)\le \eta,]and that invariant drift is within pinned bounds. The certificate includes:
loop selection policy,
loop list (by morphism identifiers),
computed residuals and drift diagnostics,
corridor mapping and quarantine triggers.
3.3 Cloud — Measure transport and uncertainty through rotations
3.3.1 Objects
3.3.1.1 Pushforward/pullback measure datatypes
Rotation calculus extends to probabilistic semantics by transporting measures and densities.
Definition 3.38 (Pushforward datatype). For measurable (T:X\to Y) and measure (\mu) on ((X,\mathcal F_X)), define the pushforward (T_#\mu) on ((Y,\mathcal F_Y)) by[(T_#\mu)(B)=\mu(T^{-1}(B)).]
Definition 3.39 (Pullback constraint). If a constraint is posed on measures on (Y), its pullback to (X) is defined by composing with (T_#). Satisfaction and residuals are evaluated after pushforward/pullback as pinned by the presentation.
Measure datatypes include:
abstract measures (\mu),
densities (p) w.r.t. a reference measure,
empirical measures (\hat\mu),
parametric families (\mu_\theta),
signed measures only when explicitly declared (otherwise forbidden).
3.3.1.2 Readout maps and induced likelihoods
Rotation changes coordinate systems and therefore changes the form of likelihoods and observation models.
Definition 3.40 (Readout and induced likelihood). For latent (Y) and observation (Z), a readout kernel (R(y,dz)) induces an observation law:[\eta(dz) = \int_Y R(y,dz), \nu(dy),]where (\nu) is the latent measure. Under rotation (T:X\to Y), (\nu=T_#\mu), so the observation law is induced by the composition (R\circ T_#).
Likelihood objects are therefore transported via the same pushforward framework, with explicit Jacobian/normalization obligations when densities are used.
3.3.1.3 Randomized transforms and kernels
Not all rotations are deterministic; some are stochastic channels.
Definition 3.41 (Randomized transform). A randomized transform from (X) to (Y) is a Markov kernel (K:X\times\mathcal F_Y\to[0,1]). Deterministic transforms are the special case (K(x,\cdot)=\delta_{T(x)}).
Randomized transforms support:
noisy coordinate changes,
stochastic coarse-graining,
randomized numerical inversions (only under pinned seed and replay policies).
3.3.1.4 Uncertainty ledger entries for each rotation step
Each rotation step carries uncertainty metadata required for certified propagation.
Definition 3.42 (Rotation uncertainty ledger entry). For step (T_i), store:[\mathcal L_i := (\mathrm{DomCert},\ \mathrm{InvCert},\ \mathrm{JacobianBounds},\ \mathrm{LipBounds},\ \mathrm{ApproxError},\ \mathrm{SamplingError},\ \mathrm{IdentifiabilityFlags})]with pinned evaluation methods and replay pointers.
Ledger entries are composable and feed directly into propagation bounds (3.3.2.4) and corridor truth decisions.
3.3.2 Calculus
3.3.2.1 Jacobian/volume factors and normalization
When densities are transported under invertible differentiable maps, change-of-variables rules govern normalization.
Definition 3.43 (Change of variables). If (T:X\to Y) is a diffeomorphism on region (S) and (\mu) has density (p_X) w.r.t. Lebesgue measure, then (\nu=T_#\mu) has density[p_Y(y) = p_X(T^{-1}(y))\ \left|\det D(T^{-1})(y)\right|.]All Jacobian determinants and their domains must be pinned and certified on the working region.
For non-invertible maps, transport requires disintegration or kernel representation; in such cases, density-based formulas are forbidden unless a certified measure-theoretic construction is provided.
3.3.2.2 KL/entropy distortion under transforms
Information quantities transform predictably under admissible maps.
Proposition 3.44 (KL invariance under bijections). If (T) is measurable and bijective on the working region with measurable inverse, then for absolutely continuous measures (\mu,\nu):[\mathrm{KL}(\mu|\nu) = \mathrm{KL}(T_#\mu|T_#\nu).]Thus KL is invariant under admissible bijective coordinate rotations (subject to domain conditions).
Rule 3.45 (Data processing under coarse maps). For non-invertible maps or kernels, divergences satisfy data processing inequalities (when applicable), yielding monotone loss of distinguishability. Any claim that a coarse rotation preserves identifiability or information must supply explicit conditions or be downgraded.
Entropy of densities shifts by expected log-Jacobian terms when moving between coordinate systems; such shifts are part of the ledger and cannot be omitted when deriving likelihoods or priors in rotated coordinates.
3.3.2.3 Identifiability boundaries under compression
Rotation can induce aliasing if it compresses degrees of freedom.
Definition 3.46 (Aliasing under transform). A transform (T:X\to Y) is aliasing on a model class ({\mu_\theta}) if distinct (\theta_1\neq\theta_2) satisfy[T_#\mu_{\theta_1} = T_#\mu_{\theta_2}]under the declared equality of measures (exact or within tolerance in a pinned metric). Aliasing forces AMBIG unless an equivalence class representation is adopted.
Invertible, admissible transforms preserve identifiability (modulo symmetry) on regions where inverse is certified. Non-invertible transforms require explicit identifiability analysis and certificate obligations.
3.3.2.4 Propagation of Lipschitz/defect bounds
Uncertainty propagation across rotations is governed by distortion constants.
If (T) is (L)-Lipschitz between metric spaces ((X,d_X)) and ((Y,d_Y)), then for Wasserstein distances:[W_p(T_#\mu, T_#\nu) \le L, W_p(\mu,\nu).]Analogous bounds exist for total variation under measurable maps and for integral probability metrics under Lipschitz observables.
Defect bounds propagate through chains by composing Lipschitz constants and adding approximation terms from the uncertainty ledger:[\Delta_{\mathrm{global}} \le \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\prod_{j=i+1}^n L_j\right)\Delta_i\ +\ \mathrm{ApproxTerms},]with all constants and terms pinned and certified.
3.3.3 Algorithms
3.3.3.1 Monte-Carlo / quadrature under rotated coordinates
Rotation-aware estimation must respect Jacobian factors and domain guards.
Algorithm 3.47 (RotateAndEstimate). Input: samples (x_k\sim \mu) on (X), transform (T), integrand (f) on (Y), and policy. Output: estimate of (\mathbb E_{T_#\mu}[f]).
Steps:
Verify (x_k\in\mathrm{Dom}_T); otherwise project/reject per policy.
Compute (y_k=T_\rightarrow(x_k)).
Estimate (\frac{1}{n}\sum_k f(y_k)). If density reweighting is required (importance sampling), incorporate weights computed from pinned Jacobian/likelihood factors with certified stability.
Emit sampling error bounds and ledger entries with pinned random seed policies.
Quadrature methods follow the same structure with deterministic node/weight rules pinned in metadata.
3.3.3.2 Robust inversion for (T^{-1}) with monotonicity guards
Numeric inversion is treated as a guarded algorithm with explicit ambiguity handling.
Algorithm 3.48 (RobustInverse). Input: (y\in Y), transform (T) with branch data, inversion policy. Output: (x=T_\leftarrow(y)) or AMBIG/FAIL.
Steps:
Check (y\in\mathrm{Cod}_T). If not, FAIL.
Determine inversion branch from (\mathrm{Branch}_T). If multiple branches are admissible on the region and policy does not pin a choice, return AMBIG with CandidateSet of branch-labelled inverses.
If inversion reduces to a monotone scalar root problem on the working interval, apply bracketed methods (bisection) with certified monotonicity guards; otherwise use pinned Newton-type methods only with certified derivative bounds and fallback to bisection/bracketing.
Verify round-trip consistency within tolerance: (T_\rightarrow(x)\approx y).
All inversion steps are logged and replayable; any heuristic branch selection is forbidden.
3.3.3.3 Evidence plans for uncertain equivalences
When measure equivalence under rotation is uncertain due to missing Jacobian bounds, sampling error, or identifiability, an evidence plan is produced.
Algorithm 3.49 (PlanEvidenceForMeasureEquivalence). Inputs: candidate equivalence claim (\mu \sim \nu) after rotations, desired metric (D), budget. Output: EvidencePlan.
Plan components:
required certificates (domain invertibility, Jacobian bounds, Lipschitz constants),
required estimators (Monte-Carlo divergences, two-sample tests) with pinned seeds and error controls,
stopping conditions to promote to NEAR/OK or to abstain.
3.3.3.4 Candidate-set generation for AMBIG
When a rotation introduces ambiguity (non-invertible map, multivalued inverse, aliasing), candidate sets enumerate plausible consistent interpretations.
Algorithm 3.50 (GenerateRotationCandidates). Output: CandidateSet over:
branch choices,
alternative admissible transforms in the same symmetry class,
alternative gauge choices,
alternative model parameters yielding identical pushforward.
Candidates must include:
explicit constraints they satisfy,
disambiguators needed to collapse the set,
a deterministic ranking rule (if ranking is permitted).
3.3.4 Certificates
3.3.4.1 Mass/positivity preservation certs
Certifies that:
pushforward measures are valid probability measures (mass (=1), nonnegative),
numerical approximations preserve mass/positivity within tolerance,
Jacobian-based density transforms remain integrable and nonnegative on the working region.
Includes analytic proofs or replayable verification of normalization.
3.3.4.2 Error propagation certs
Certifies end-to-end error bounds across a rotation chain for chosen metrics/divergences, using ledger entries:
Lipschitz/Jacobian distortion constants,
approximation errors,
sampling errors with concentration bounds.
The certificate must pin all constants and provide a deterministic computation transcript.
3.3.4.3 Identifiability certs (or abstention)
Provides either:
proof that rotations preserve identifiability on a declared region (typically requiring invertibility and domain closure), or
explicit aliasing classes, or
an abstention outcome with a finite evidence plan specifying additional observables or interventions required.
3.3.4.4 Inversion uniqueness certs
Certifies that (T_\leftarrow) is single-valued on the declared region, equivalently that (T) is injective (or bijective) on the region, with:
branch cut exclusions,
monotonicity or Jacobian nondegeneracy bounds,
round-trip integrity bounds.
Without inversion uniqueness, rotation claims that require pullback via (T^{-1}) are downgraded.
3.4 Fractal — Rotation chains across scales
3.4.1 Objects
3.4.1.1 Scale ladders of transforms
A multiscale rotation is a family of transforms indexed by resolution.
Definition 3.51 (Scale ladder). A scale ladder is an ordered index set (\mathcal E) and a family[\mathbf T := {T_\epsilon:X_\epsilon \leftrightarrow X_{\epsilon'}}_{(\epsilon,\epsilon')\in \mathcal E\times\mathcal E}]with pinned adjacency rules (typically between neighboring scales). Each transform carries its own domains, branches, and certificates; the ladder is admissible only where cross-scale consistency obligations are satisfied.
3.4.1.2 Coarse/fine corridor projectors
Coarse/fine consistency is enforced by explicit projectors and corridor maps.
Definition 3.52 (Coarse/fine projectors). A pair ((R_\epsilon,P_\epsilon)) consists of restriction (R_\epsilon:X_{\text{fine}}\to X_\epsilon) and prolongation (P_\epsilon:X_\epsilon\to X_{\text{fine}}), together with pinned consistency targets (e.g., (R_\epsilon P_\epsilon\approx I) on (X_\epsilon)). These projectors define admissible regions for cross-scale rotations and are treated as transforms with obligations.
3.4.1.3 RG-induced rotations and fixed points
Renormalization induces canonical cross-scale transforms and organizes equivalence.
Definition 3.53 (RG-induced rotation). An RG step is treated as a transform (\mathcal R:X_\epsilon\to X_{\epsilon'}) on parameters or states; the induced rotation on presentations is obtained by transporting constraints through (R_\epsilon,P_\epsilon) and (\mathcal R), with explicit residual and invariant tracking.
Fixed-point objects (\theta^\star) and linearization data are first-class, enabling canonicalization of deep chains by attracting to stable normal forms when contractivity is certified.
3.4.1.4 Nested commutator “twist” objects
Noncommutation between scale change and representation change produces twist artifacts.
Definition 3.54 (Scale-rotation twist). Given a scale-change map (R) and a rotation (T), define the twist commutator on a region (S) by[\Delta_{\mathrm{twist}}(S) := \sup_{x\in S} d\big((R\circ T)(x),\ (T'\circ R)(x)\big),]where (T') is the induced rotation on the coarse space (when defined). Nested twists arise by iterating scale changes and rotations, producing higher-order commutator defects that serve as obstructions to universality or to scale-stable equivalence.
Twist objects are recorded as atoms because they determine whether a representation is stable across refinements and whether coarse-grained equivalence can be promoted to fine-grained equivalence.
3.4.2 Calculus
3.4.2.1 Coarse-grain commutation vs obstruction
Coarse-graining should commute with rotation when the rotated representation is compatible with the observables retained by coarse-graining.
Rule 3.55 (Commutation criterion). A rotation (T) commutes with coarse-graining (R) on region (S) if there exists an induced (T') on the coarse space such that (\Delta_{\mathrm{twist}}(S)=0) (or (\le\varepsilon) under NEAR). If no such (T') exists or if a certified lower bound on (\Delta_{\mathrm{twist}}) is positive, the pair exhibits a scale-rotation obstruction.
Obstructions imply that certain representations are intrinsically scale-dependent and cannot be treated as globally equivalent across refinements.
3.4.2.2 Universality classes as equivalence objects
Universality is treated as an explicit equivalence relation indexed by scale and observables.
Definition 3.56 (Universality object). A universality object is a record:[\mathcal U := (\mathcal P,\ \mathcal Q,\ \mathcal E,\ {\mathrm{Obs}\epsilon},\ {\varepsilon\epsilon},\ \mathrm{WitnessPtr})]asserting that coarse projections of (\mathcal P) and (\mathcal Q) are equivalent on observables (\mathrm{Obs}\epsilon) with defects (\le\varepsilon\epsilon). Universality objects are distinct from exact equivalence; they are admissible only under scale-dependent corridor policies.
3.4.2.3 Stability of invariants under refinement
Invariants transported through a scale ladder must stabilize.
Definition 3.57 (Invariant stability). An invariant (I_\epsilon) at scale (\epsilon) is stable if the sequence (I_{\epsilon_k}) converges under refinement (in a pinned metric) or if differences are bounded by a decreasing budget:[d(I_{\epsilon_{k+1}}, I_{\epsilon_k})\le b_k,\qquad b_k\downarrow 0.]Stability is required to promote coarse equivalences to fine equivalences or to treat deep chains as canonical normal routes.
3.4.2.4 Budget algebra for deep chains
Deep rotation chains accumulate defect, uncertainty, and proof obligations; budgets govern admissibility.
Budget objects include:
per-step defect tolerances (\varepsilon_i),
distortion constants (L_i),
per-scale tolerances (\varepsilon_\epsilon),
maximum allowed obligation counts,
maximum allowed compute for replay.
Rule 3.58 (Budget closure). A chain is admissible under a corridor if the composed defect bound, uncertainty ledger, and obligation set satisfy pinned closure inequalities:[\Delta_{\mathrm{global}} \le \varepsilon_{\mathrm{corridor}},\qquad \mathrm{Obligations}\ \text{closed},\qquad \mathrm{ReplayCost}\le \mathrm{Budget}.]Failure of any component forces downgrade (NEAR/AMBIG) or FAIL.
3.4.3 Algorithms
3.4.3.1 Multigrid/RG chain compiler
Multiscale transport is compiled as a structured chain over scales and within scales.
Algorithm 3.59 (CompileMultiscaleRotationChain). Input: base presentation (\mathcal P), scale ladder (\mathcal E), projectors ((R_\epsilon,P_\epsilon)), per-scale transforms (T_\epsilon), corridor policy. Output: replay script and defect/uncertainty ledgers.
Steps:
For each adjacent scale pair, compile restriction and prolongation obligations and certify (RP\approx I) where required.
Transport (\mathcal P) to each scale by composing admissible transforms, producing (\mathcal P_\epsilon).
Within each scale, compile representation rotations (T_\epsilon) and commuting-square obligations with coarse/fine maps.
Emit twist defects and holonomy checks for pinned loop families that mix scale changes and rotations.
Seal script with deterministic ordering and hashes.
3.4.3.2 Fixed-point search and contraction tracking
Fixed points serve as canonical anchors for deep chains when contraction is present.
Algorithm 3.60 (TrackContractionAndAnchor). Input: RG maps (\mathcal R), initial state/parameter (\theta_0), region (S), metric (d), budget. Output: contraction report and (if available) anchored normal form.
Steps:
Iterate (\theta_{k+1}=\mathcal R(\theta_k)) while (\theta_k\in S).
Track defect (e_k=d(\theta_{k+1},\theta_k)) and estimate contraction factor (\kappa).
If a certified (\kappa<1) holds and (e_k\to 0) within budget, emit fixed-point object and use it to canonicalize transform families around (\theta^\star).
Otherwise, emit AMBIG with an evidence plan or FAIL if domain violations occur.
3.4.3.3 Adaptive route refinement based on residuals
When defects exceed budgets, the chain is refined by inserting intermediate scales, changing gauge choices, or selecting alternate rotations with lower twist defects.
Algorithm 3.61 (RefineRotationRoute). Input: chain (\mathbf T), defect ledger, budget. Output: refined chain or abstention.
Steps:
Identify maximal contributors to (\Delta_{\mathrm{global}}) (worst steps or worst twist commutators).
For each contributor, attempt:
local gauge change (symmetry-coherent normal form selection),
domain refinement with additional guards,
insertion of intermediate transform steps (adjacent-swap refinement),
scale refinement (insert intermediate (\epsilon)).
Recompile and recompute defects deterministically.
Stop when the chain meets budget closure or when refinement budget is exhausted (abstain with evidence plan).
3.4.3.4 Compression of chains into seeds
Deep chains are stored compactly as seeds with replayable expansion.
Algorithm 3.62 (CompressChainToSeed). Input: canonical chain (\mathbf T^\star), certificates, ledgers. Output: seed (\mathfrak s) that regenerates the chain.
Seed contents:
chain skeleton (transform identifiers and canonical order),
composed transform summary (when admissible),
required domains/branches,
defect bounds and uncertainty ledgers,
witness pointers and replay pointers,
policy hashes.
Compression must be idempotent under expansion:[\mathrm{Compress}(\mathrm{Expand}(\mathfrak s))=\mathfrak s]under pinned policy and index snapshot.
3.4.4 Certificates
3.4.4.1 Contraction certs
Contraction certs justify convergence and stability in deep chains.
They establish, on a pinned region and metric:[d(\mathcal R(x),\mathcal R(y))\le \kappa, d(x,y),\qquad \kappa<1,]or an equivalent multiscale contraction for composed operators. Contraction certs support promotion of NEAR claims by guaranteeing defect decay under iteration.
3.4.4.2 Universality certs
Universality certificates verify equivalence on observables across a scale ladder with explicit defect budgets:[\Delta_\epsilon \le \varepsilon_\epsilon \quad \forall \epsilon\in\mathcal E,]and include:
observable sets,
evaluation method at each scale,
twist defect bounds ensuring coherence between scale and representation changes,
explicit statement of what is not claimed (non-universal degrees excluded).
3.4.4.3 Chain-budget certs
Chain-budget certs verify budget closure for a deep chain:
composed defect bound meets corridor tolerance,
uncertainty ledger satisfies propagation constraints,
all required obligations are closed or explicitly ticketed under permitted corridors,
replay cost is within pinned compute limits.
Budget certs are required for treating a deep chain as an admissible “normal route” in the manuscript.
3.4.4.4 Compression/expansion equivalence certs
Compression/expansion certifies that a chain seed preserves semantics and certificates when expanded.
Requirements:
expansion regenerates the identical canonical chain and transcript under pinned policies,
all certificates referenced by the seed remain valid (or are version-migrated with explicit records),
recomputed defects match stored bounds (within pinned tolerances),
no hidden dependencies are introduced by expansion (reference closure preserved).
CHAPTER 3 — ROTATION CALCULUS: CONJUGACY, GROUPOIDS, NORMAL FORMS (Addr ⟨0002⟩₄)
Chapter 4 — Corridor Policies & Truth Lattice (Addr ⟨0003⟩₄)
4.1 Square — Formal truth typing
4.1.1 Objects
4.1.1.1 Truth lattice (\mathbb T) and semantics
Truth in this manuscript is not boolean. Every claim is assigned a value in a closed, policy-governed lattice:[\mathbb T := {\mathrm{OK},\ \mathrm{NEAR},\ \mathrm{AMBIG},\ \mathrm{FAIL}}.]
Definition 4.1 (Verdict). A verdict is a tuple[\mathrm{Verdict} := (t,\ \mathrm{CorridorID},\ \mathrm{Payload}),]where (t\in\mathbb T), (\mathrm{CorridorID}) identifies the governing policy, and (\mathrm{Payload}) is a normal-form record (4.1.1.4).
Definition 4.2 (Semantic meaning of lattice values).
(\mathrm{OK}): the claim is closed under the corridor policy: all required dependencies resolve, all required witnesses are present, all required replay checks pass, and all required defect/residual bounds are satisfied with no untracked assumptions.
(\mathrm{NEAR}): the claim is supported by bounded evidence but remains approximate or incomplete under policy: defect/residual bounds are certified within tolerance, yet at least one of the following holds: (i) approximation ledger remains nonzero, (ii) obligations remain open but permitted, (iii) stability hypotheses are local or conditional.
(\mathrm{AMBIG}): the claim cannot be assigned a unique referent or unique semantic closure under policy; a finite CandidateSet and an EvidencePlan exist and are returned in the payload. AMBIG is a constructive state: it must contain a terminating plan for resolution or a pinned abstention condition.
(\mathrm{FAIL}): the claim is illegal or unverifiable under policy: required dependencies do not resolve under strict conditions, domain/branch admissibility fails, a certified lower bound violates tolerance, or a contradiction is certified.
Definition 4.3 (Admissible inference under (\mathbb T)). An inference step is admissible only if:
it does not promote (\mathrm{AMBIG}) or (\mathrm{FAIL}) to (\mathrm{OK}) without new witnesses and replay closure, and
it does not suppress or discard obligations, ledger entries, or ambiguity sets.
Definition 4.4 (Policy monotonicity). Fix a corridor policy (C). Let (\mathcal E) be the set of evidence items (witnesses, replays, certificates) that satisfy the corridor’s admissibility criteria. If evidence grows monotonically (\mathcal E_0\subseteq \mathcal E_1\subseteq \cdots), then:
verdicts may improve (e.g., (\mathrm{NEAR}\to\mathrm{OK}), (\mathrm{AMBIG}\to\mathrm{NEAR}) or (\mathrm{OK})) only by incorporating new evidence;
verdicts may degrade (e.g., (\mathrm{OK}\to\mathrm{NEAR}) or (\mathrm{FAIL})) when new contradictions or stronger checks are introduced, or when policies tighten.
4.1.1.2 Corridors as content-addressed policy objects
A corridor is the policy kernel that binds semantics, admissibility, allowable approximations, and required certification for claims.
Definition 4.5 (Corridor policy object). A corridor is a record[C := (\mathrm{PolicyNF},\ \mathrm{PolicyHash}),]where (\mathrm{PolicyNF}) is a canonical normal form and (\mathrm{PolicyHash}) is a content hash of (\mathrm{PolicyNF}). The corridor identifier is (\mathrm{CorridorID}:=\mathrm{PolicyHash}).
Definition 4.6 (PolicyNF schema). (\mathrm{PolicyNF}) contains, at minimum:
Scope constraints: permissible scopes for dependencies and citations (INTRA/INTER/EXTERNAL) and pinning requirements for EXTERNAL.
Admissibility constraints: required domain/branch properties (single-valuedness, invertibility conditions, Jacobian bounds, monotonicity guards).
Defect metrics: pinned definitions of defect for commuting diagrams, commutators, conjugacy, holonomy, lattice preservation, probabilistic distortions.
Tolerances: numeric or symbolic tolerances per defect class:[\varepsilon_{\square},\ \varepsilon_{[,\cdot,\cdot,]},\ \varepsilon_{\mathrm{conj}},\ \varepsilon_{\mathrm{inv}},\ \varepsilon_{\mathrm{mass}},\ \varepsilon_{\mathrm{tail}},\ \dots]
Budget model: compute/time budget, proof depth budget, loop enumeration budget, recursion budget, and a composition law (4.1.2.4).
Required artifacts: required witness kinds (definitions, theorems, certificates), required replay harness versions, required test suites, and required closure predicates.
Upgrade/downgrade rules: formal rules mapping evidence and ledgers to the lattice (\mathbb T) (4.1.2.1, 4.1.3.4).
Definition 4.7 (Corridor determinism). Two claims evaluated under the same (\mathrm{PolicyNF}), same index snapshot, and same evidence set must yield identical verdicts and identical payloads (byte-level) after normalization. Any non-determinism in evaluation is illegal unless explicitly pinned and recorded as an admissible randomized method with content-addressed seeds.
4.1.1.3 Residual ledgers and obligation lists
Corridor truth is computed against explicit ledgers and obligations.
Definition 4.8 (Residual ledger). A residual ledger is an append-only sequence of records:[\mathcal L := (\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_m),]where each (\ell_k) is a typed residual entry:[\ell := (\mathrm{Class},\ \mathrm{Name},\ \mathrm{Value},\ \mathrm{Bound},\ \mathrm{Method},\ \mathrm{Domain},\ \mathrm{Assumptions},\ \mathrm{ReplayPtr},\ \mathrm{WitnessPtr}).]
(\mathrm{Class}) identifies residual type (e.g., (\square)-defect, commutator defect, inversion defect, probabilistic divergence, contraction defect).
(\mathrm{Value}) is a computed bound or estimate.
(\mathrm{Bound}) encodes whether (\mathrm{Value}) is an upper bound, lower bound, interval bound, or estimate with confidence.
(\mathrm{Assumptions}) lists the assumptions used (regularity, boundedness, tail behavior, invertibility).Ledgers are mandatory for NEAR; OK requires that all ledger entries either vanish (exact) or are explicitly permitted as bounded approximations under policy and fully closed by certificates.
Definition 4.9 (Obligation). An obligation is a required unresolved item that blocks OK closure unless explicitly permitted by policy:[\mathrm{Obligation} := (\mathrm{OblID},\ \mathrm{SrcAddr},\ \mathrm{Kind},\ \mathrm{TargetRef},\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{Requirement},\ \mathrm{DueCorridor},\ \mathrm{EvidencePlanID},\ \mathrm{Status}).]
(\mathrm{Kind}) indicates dependency type (DEF/THM/ALG/CERT/REPLAY/TEST/EXTERNAL-PIN).
(\mathrm{Requirement}) specifies what must be produced (a certificate with threshold, a witness, an external pin).
(\mathrm{Status}\in{\mathrm{OPEN},\mathrm{SATISFIED},\mathrm{BLOCKED},\mathrm{WAIVED}}) with WAIVED allowed only under explicit policy conditions and recorded as a corridor-specific exception.
Definition 4.10 (Obligation list). For a claim at address (A), the obligation list is[\mathcal O(A):={ \mathrm{Obligation}j}{j=1}^r]computed by dependency closure (4.1.2.3) and by corridor requirements.
4.1.1.4 Normal forms for verdict payloads
Verdict payloads are normalized to enable deterministic replay, caching, and comparison.
Definition 4.11 (Verdict payload normal form, VNF). A payload is in VNF when it is a record:[\mathrm{Payload} := (\mathrm{ClaimID},\ \mathrm{ClaimAddr},\ \mathrm{StatementHash},\ \mathrm{Truth},\ \mathrm{CorridorID},\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{Region},\ \mathrm{Invariants},\ \mathcal L,\ \mathcal O,\ \mathrm{CandidateSet},\ \mathrm{EvidencePlan},\ \mathrm{WitnessSet},\ \mathrm{ReplaySet},\ \mathrm{BudgetUse},\ \mathrm{TimestampPolicy})]with the following constraints:
All addresses are GlobalAddr in normal form.
(\mathrm{StatementHash}) is the hash of the canonical statement representation (typed AST or canonical text NF).
(\mathrm{Region}) is explicit: domain set (S), scale range, and branch declarations used for evaluation.
(\mathrm{Invariants}) lists the invariants the claim is asserting (spectral invariants, conservation laws, lattice invariants, measure invariants) and the methods used to verify them.
(\mathcal L) and (\mathcal O) are sorted deterministically by (Class, Name, Addr, OblID).
(\mathrm{CandidateSet}) and (\mathrm{EvidencePlan}) are included iff (\mathrm{Truth}=\mathrm{AMBIG}); they must be absent otherwise.
(\mathrm{WitnessSet}) and (\mathrm{ReplaySet}) are included for (\mathrm{OK}) and (\mathrm{NEAR}) as required by policy.
(\mathrm{BudgetUse}) records consumption of declared budgets (compute, proof depth, loop enumeration, recursion steps).
VNF is required for all persisted verdicts; any non-normalized verdict is considered an intermediate computation artifact and may not be used to justify downstream OK conclusions.
4.1.2 Calculus
4.1.2.1 OK/NEAR/AMBIG/FAIL transition rules
Verdict transitions are governed by explicit rules dependent on corridor policy and evidence state.
Let a claim (K) be evaluated in context ((C,\mathcal I,\mathcal E)), where:
(C) is the corridor policy,
(\mathcal I) is the index snapshot (addresses and dependencies),
(\mathcal E) is the evidence set (witnesses, replays, certificates).
Define:
(\mathrm{Closed}(K;C,\mathcal I,\mathcal E)): closure predicate (4.1.2.3),
(\mathrm{Admissible}(K;C,\mathcal I)): domain/branch admissibility predicate,
(\mathrm{DefectsOK}(K;C,\mathcal E)): all relevant defect bounds satisfy corridor tolerances,
(\mathrm{Ambiguous}(K;C,\mathcal I)): candidate non-uniqueness or semantic ambiguity remains.
Rule 4.12 (Verdict assignment).[\mathrm{Verdict}(K)=\begin{cases}\mathrm{FAIL} & \text{if } \neg \mathrm{Admissible}\ \lor\ \mathrm{Contradiction}(K)\ \lor\ \mathrm{LowerBoundViolation}(K),\[4pt]\mathrm{AMBIG} & \text{if } \mathrm{Ambiguous}(K)\ \land\ \mathrm{EvidencePlanExists}(K),\[4pt]\mathrm{OK} & \text{if } \mathrm{Closed}(K)\ \land\ \mathrm{DefectsOK}(K)\ \land\ \neg\mathrm{LedgerViolations}(K),\[4pt]\mathrm{NEAR} & \text{otherwise if } \mathrm{DefectsOK}(K)\ \land\ \mathrm{PermittedOpenObligations}(K;C),\[4pt]\mathrm{AMBIG} & \text{otherwise if } \mathrm{EvidencePlanExists}(K),\[4pt]\mathrm{FAIL} & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}]
Rule 4.13 (Monotone strengthening). Under fixed (C) and (\mathcal I), adding evidence (\mathcal E\subseteq \mathcal E') may promote:[\mathrm{AMBIG}\to\mathrm{NEAR},\quad \mathrm{AMBIG}\to\mathrm{OK},\quad \mathrm{NEAR}\to\mathrm{OK},]but never promotes (\mathrm{FAIL}) without an explicit change of admissibility status (e.g., corrected domain declarations, corrected branch pinning) recorded as a new claim instance with new StatementHash or explicit migration record.
Rule 4.14 (Conservative downgrade). Under corridor tightening or new contradiction evidence, verdict may downgrade:[\mathrm{OK}\to\mathrm{NEAR},\quad \mathrm{OK}\to\mathrm{FAIL},\quad \mathrm{NEAR}\to\mathrm{AMBIG}\text{ or }\mathrm{FAIL}.]Downgrades must emit explicit rationale in payload: which predicate failed and the minimal witness/defect responsible.
4.1.2.2 Abstention precedence law
Abstention is an enforced discipline: when closure or uniqueness cannot be certified, the system must not guess.
Law 4.15 (Abstention precedence).
If any required dependency is unresolved under a strict requirement, verdict may not be (\mathrm{OK}).
If a reference resolves to multiple candidates under policy and disambiguation is not pinned, verdict must be (\mathrm{AMBIG}) with CandidateSet and EvidencePlan.
If domain/branch admissibility is uncertain and cannot be certified, verdict must be (\mathrm{AMBIG}) or (\mathrm{FAIL}) according to policy; it may not be (\mathrm{NEAR}) or (\mathrm{OK}).
If a lower bound certificate proves defect exceeds tolerance, verdict must be (\mathrm{FAIL}); it may not be “practically OK.”
Abstention precedence is applied locally (per subclaim) and globally (for composed claims): an OK composite may not depend on AMBIG subclaims unless the corridor explicitly permits such dependency and records it as a scoped conditional claim.
4.1.2.3 Closure predicates and dependency closure
Closure is defined by explicit dependency graphs, not by narrative.
Let (\mathrm{Deps}(K)) be the set of required dependencies of a claim (K), computed by following typed references of required kinds under corridor policy.
Definition 4.16 (Dependency closure operator). Given a claim (K) and policy (C), define the closure operator[\mathrm{Close}_C(K) := \text{least fixed point of dependency expansion of }K\text{ over required edge kinds}.]The closure is computed by:
including all required definitional dependencies (DEF),
including all required theorems/lemmas (THM),
including all required algorithms/implementations (ALG/IMPL) if the claim is computational,
including all required certificates and replay scripts (CERT/REPLAY/TEST) per policy,
including all required EXTERNAL pins if referenced.
Definition 4.17 (Closure predicate). The closure predicate (\mathrm{Closed}(K;C,\mathcal I,\mathcal E)) holds iff:
every dependency in (\mathrm{Close}_C(K)) resolves to a unique GlobalAddr under (\mathcal I),
every dependency’s corridor status satisfies the dependency policy (typically at least NEAR, often OK),
every required certificate/replay is present in (\mathcal E) and passes under pinned harness,
the union of all obligation lists in the closure is empty or contains only obligations explicitly permitted as open under (C) (and such openness is recorded).
Definition 4.18 (Minimal witness set). A minimal witness set for (K) under corridor (C) is a minimal subset of (\mathcal E) sufficient to establish (\mathrm{Closed}(K)) and (\mathrm{DefectsOK}(K)) by replay.
Closure is computed deterministically and emitted as a structured artifact: the closure graph, the obligations introduced, and the minimal witness set, all pinned to the corridor hash.
4.1.2.4 Budget algebra (tolerances, commutators, time)
Budgets are first-class algebraic objects governing admissibility and promotion.
Definition 4.19 (Budget vector). A corridor budget is a vector[B := (B_{\mathrm{def}},\ B_{\mathrm{unc}},\ B_{\mathrm{time}},\ B_{\mathrm{comp}},\ B_{\mathrm{loop}},\ B_{\mathrm{rec}},\ B_{\mathrm{proof}}),]where:
(B_{\mathrm{def}}) assigns tolerances to defect classes,
(B_{\mathrm{unc}}) assigns tolerances to uncertainty and estimator risk,
(B_{\mathrm{time}}) caps wall-clock time for replay,
(B_{\mathrm{comp}}) caps compute steps or complexity,
(B_{\mathrm{loop}}) caps loop/holonomy enumeration,
(B_{\mathrm{rec}}) caps recursion depth/iterations,
(B_{\mathrm{proof}}) caps proof depth/lemma expansion.
Definition 4.20 (Budget composition). For composition of steps in a chain, budgets are composed by pinned laws:
additive accumulation for absolute defect bounds:[\varepsilon_{\mathrm{global}} \le \sum_i \varepsilon_i,]
multiplicative accumulation for distortion/Lipschitz constants:[L_{\mathrm{global}} = \prod_i L_i,]
mixed laws for propagated bounds:[\Delta_{\mathrm{global}} \le \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\prod_{j=i+1}^n L_j\right)\Delta_i + \mathrm{ApproxTerms}.]Time and compute budgets are additive across steps; recursion and loop budgets are capped by maxima.
Rule 4.21 (Budget closure). A claim may be OK or NEAR under corridor (C) only if all computed uses of budget components remain within corridor bounds and all required terms of the propagation algebra are either computed or bounded by certified inequalities. Missing budget terms force AMBIG.
4.1.3 Algorithms
4.1.3.1 Verdict evaluation pipeline
Verdict evaluation is a deterministic pipeline producing VNF payloads.
Algorithm 4.22 (EvaluateVerdict). Input: claim (K) (typed statement + address), corridor (C), index snapshot (\mathcal I), evidence repository (\mathcal E). Output: (\mathrm{Verdict}\in\mathbb T) with VNF payload.
Stages:
Parse + normalize: compute (\mathrm{StatementHash}), normalize all referenced objects to NF.
Admissibility check: verify declared domains/branches for all transforms and evaluation maps needed by (K). If violation: FAIL with minimal witness.
Dependency closure: compute (\mathrm{Close}_C(K)) and collect obligations (\mathcal O).
Candidate resolution: resolve all references under policy; if collisions remain under strict requirements: AMBIG with CandidateSet and EvidencePlan.
Defect/residual evaluation: evaluate all required defect classes and residual metrics using pinned methods (analytic bounds or deterministic replay test suites), producing ledger (\mathcal L).
Budget check: compute budget use (\mathrm{BudgetUse}) and verify within (C).
Truth assignment: apply Rule 4.12 and produce final VNF payload.
Pseudocode:
function EvaluateVerdict(K, C, I, E):
H = hash_normal_form(K.statement)
if not admissible(K, C, I): return FAIL_payload(K,C,H, minimal_witness(...))
Cl = dependency_closure(K, C, I)
(resolutions, cand) = resolve_all_refs(Cl, C, I)
if cand.nonempty and requires_unique(C): return AMBIG_payload(K,C,H,cand, plan(...))
(L, budget_use, status) = evaluate_defects_and_budgets(K, Cl, C, I, E)
O = generate_obligations(K, Cl, C, I, E)
return assign_truth_and_build_payload(K,C,H,L,O,cand, budget_use)
The pipeline is pure relative to (\mathcal I) and (\mathcal E); any external access is deferred into EvidencePlan steps and cannot affect a verdict directly.
4.1.3.2 Obligation generation and ticketing
Obligations are generated systematically from corridor requirements and observed gaps.
Algorithm 4.23 (GenerateObligations). Input: claim (K), closure graph (\mathrm{Close}_C(K)), corridor (C), evidence set (\mathcal E). Output: obligation list (\mathcal O(K)).
Rules for obligation creation:
Unresolved required dependency (\Rightarrow) obligation of kind DEF/THM/ALG with STRICT requirement.
Missing required certificate (\Rightarrow) obligation of kind CERT with threshold and method requirements.
Missing required replay transcript (\Rightarrow) obligation of kind REPLAY referencing pinned harness version.
EXTERNAL citation without fingerprint (\Rightarrow) obligation of kind EXTERNAL-PIN.
Unbounded defect term in budget algebra (\Rightarrow) obligation requesting bound/certificate.
Ambiguous branch choice (\Rightarrow) obligation requesting branch pinning or set-valued semantics conversion.
Ticketing:
Each obligation receives (\mathrm{OblID}) content-addressed by its normalized fields.
Each obligation references an EvidencePlanID specifying the minimal steps needed to satisfy it.
Obligations are appended to a chapter-level obligation registry for closure audits.
4.1.3.3 Corridor selection and kernel pinning
Corridor selection is deterministic and explicit; the selected corridor is pinned as part of the verdict payload.
Algorithm 4.24 (SelectCorridor). Input: claim (K), candidate corridor set ({C_i}), policy selection rule (\Pi). Output: selected corridor (C^\star).
Selection rules:
Determine the minimal corridor class that is admissible for the claim type (symbolic, numeric, probabilistic, multiscale).
Prefer the strongest corridor (tightest tolerances, strongest closure) compatible with available evidence, unless (\Pi) specifies a different priority (e.g., cost-aware).
Break ties deterministically by corridor hash order.
Kernel pinning:
The evaluation kernel (parser, normalizer, defect calculators, replay harness) is pinned by version identifiers included in (\mathrm{PolicyNF}).
The verdict payload includes the kernel IDs; any later re-evaluation under different kernel IDs constitutes a distinct verdict instance.
4.1.3.4 Automated downgrade/upgrade ((\mathrm{NEAR}\to\mathrm{OK})) under new evidence
Corridor truth supports controlled promotion when missing obligations are satisfied and bounds are tightened.
Algorithm 4.25 (UpdateVerdictWithEvidence). Input: existing verdict payload (P), new evidence (\Delta\mathcal E), corridor (C), index (\mathcal I). Output: updated verdict payload (P').
Rules:
Recompute closure predicate on (\mathrm{Close}_C(K)) with (\mathcal E\cup\Delta\mathcal E).
Recompute only those defect bounds and ledger terms affected by new evidence (incremental recomputation).
If all obligations are satisfied and ledger terms are within OK requirements, promote:[\mathrm{NEAR}\to\mathrm{OK}.]
If new evidence introduces contradictions, domain violations, or stronger lower bounds, downgrade accordingly.
Preserve deterministic history: prior payload remains immutable; updated payload references prior payload hash and includes a delta ledger.
Promotion is only permitted when the corridor policy explicitly defines the certification conditions under which NEAR becomes OK, including required stability certificates and round-trip integrity certificates when relevant.
4.1.4 Certificates
4.1.4.1 OK closure cert
An OK closure certificate proves that (\mathrm{Closed}(K;C,\mathcal I,\mathcal E)) holds and that the verdict is OK.
Certificate contents:
Closure graph listing all dependencies and their resolved addresses.
Proof that every dependency meets required corridor status.
Proof that all required certificates are present and verified.
Proof that all replays pass under pinned harness and test suite.
Proof that obligation list is empty (or, if corridor permits specific waivers, explicit waiver records pinned to policy with justification).
Proof that all defect metrics satisfy corridor tolerances and that budget use is within limits.
4.1.4.2 Residual bound cert (NEAR)
A residual bound certificate establishes NEAR correctness by bounding approximation and defect terms.
Certificate contents:
Full residual ledger (\mathcal L) with explicit interpretation of each term.
Proof that each term is an upper bound (or interval bound) with pinned method.
Proof that combined bound satisfies corridor NEAR thresholds.
Enumerated open obligations permitted under policy and evidence plans to close them.
Stability conditions under which the bounds remain valid (local region, regularity assumptions).
4.1.4.3 AMBIG evidence plan cert
An AMBIG evidence plan certificate establishes that AMBIG is constructive: the evidence plan is finite, terminating, and sufficient to decide promotion or justified abstention.
Certificate contents:
CandidateSet with explicit disambiguators.
EvidencePlan specifying deterministic steps (queries, computations, required certificates).
Stop rules guaranteeing termination within budget or an explicit abstention condition.
Proof that each plan step is admissible under corridor policy and does not require unpinned nondeterminism.
4.1.4.4 FAIL minimal witness cert
A FAIL minimal witness certificate isolates the minimal cause of failure.
Certificate contents:
The failed predicate (admissibility violation, unresolved strict dependency, certified lower bound violation, contradiction).
Minimal witness set sufficient to reproduce the failure by replay.
Localization: the smallest set of atoms/edges/guards whose repair would potentially remove FAIL, or proof that the failure is intrinsic (obstruction lower bound).
A repair plan template when failure is not intrinsic (e.g., add branch guards, pin external, provide missing certificate).
4.2 Flower — Coherence constraints and obstruction calculus
4.2.1 Objects
4.2.1.1 Equivariance defects and commutator defects
Coherence is governed by defects that measure failure of symmetry and failure of commutation.
Definition 4.26 (Equivariance defect). Let (G) act on (X) and (\mathbb V) with representation (\rho). For presentation (\mathcal P=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0,\mathrm{Dom},\mathrm{Meta})), define:[\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}(\mathcal P;g,x) := d_{\mathbb V}\big(\Phi(g\cdot x),\ \rho(g)\Phi(x)\big),]and on region (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}):[\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}(\mathcal P;S) := \sup_{g\in\mathcal G,\ x\in S} \Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}(\mathcal P;g,x),]where (\mathcal G) is a pinned generator set and (d_{\mathbb V}) is pinned.
Definition 4.27 (Commutator defect). For endomorphisms (u,v) on (X),[\Delta_{[u,v]}(S) := \sup_{x\in S} d_X\big(u(v(x)),\ v(u(x))\big).]
Definition 4.28 (Diagram defect). For a commuting square of morphisms (\square) with two composed paths (\pi_1,\pi_2:A\to D),[\Delta_{\square}(S) := \sup_{x\in S} d_D\big(\pi_1(x),\pi_2(x)\big).]
These defects are typed by corridor policy: the metric (d), region (S), and evaluation method are part of the corridor’s semantics.
4.2.1.2 Symmetry-compatibility corridors
A symmetry-compatibility corridor is a corridor policy specialized to enforce coherence constraints.
Definition 4.29 (Symmetry corridor). A symmetry corridor (C_{\mathrm{sym}}) is a corridor (C) augmented with:
required symmetry declarations (group action data and generator sets),
required equivariance checks and defect thresholds,
required gauge objects and gauge-fixing certificates where applicable,
required commutation obligations (commuting squares) for specified morphism families.
Symmetry corridors define which symmetries must be preserved exactly (OK only) and which may be preserved approximately (NEAR), including explicit defect thresholds and stability hypotheses.
4.2.1.3 Lattice-preservation metrics
Discrete structures impose hard coherence constraints.
Definition 4.30 (Lattice preservation metric). Let (L\subseteq X) be a pinned discrete lattice or combinatorial structure. For a transform (T), define lattice defect on a finite test subset (L_S\subseteq L) by:[\Delta_{\mathrm{lat}}(T;L_S) := \max_{x\in L_S} d_L\big(\Pi_L(T(x)),\ T(x)\big),]where (\Pi_L) is the nearest-lattice projection (pinned and deterministic) and (d_L) is a pinned discrete metric. In linear settings with matrix representation (A), lattice preservation may be asserted by algebraic conditions (e.g., (A\in \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb Z))); in such cases, (\Delta_{\mathrm{lat}}) is replaced by an exact admissibility predicate.
Lattice metrics also cover:
preservation of parity classes,
preservation of modular residues,
preservation of combinatorial adjacency,
preservation of discrete spectra labels.
4.2.1.4 Gauge-fixing invertibility objects
Gauge choices are coherence tools but can fail by non-invertibility or topological obstruction.
Definition 4.31 (Gauge-fixing object). A gauge-fixing object is a tuple[\mathcal G := (G,\ \cdot,\ C,\ \mathrm{Slice},\ \mathrm{Jac},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]where:
(G) is the symmetry group acting on (X),
(C:X\to\mathbb R^k) is a gauge constraint map defining a slice by (C(x)=0),
(\mathrm{Slice}\subseteq X) is the intended gauge-fixed subset,
(\mathrm{Jac}) specifies Jacobian data needed to certify invertibility of the gauge map (g\mapsto C(g\cdot x)) near a solution,
(\mathrm{Meta}) pins admissible regions and fallback behavior (AMBIG vs FAIL) for non-unique gauge solutions.
Invertibility objects include:
local invertibility constants,
condition numbers,
excluded sets (where gauge degenerates),
holonomy diagnostics indicating global obstruction.
4.2.2 Calculus
4.2.2.1 Diagram-defect (\to) verdict mapping
Coherence defects are mapped into corridor truth by explicit thresholding and admissibility conditions.
Let (C_{\mathrm{sym}}) define thresholds (\varepsilon_{\square},\varepsilon_{[,\cdot,\cdot,]},\varepsilon_{\mathrm{eq}}), and, where appropriate, obstruction lower bound thresholds (\eta_{\square},\eta_{\mathrm{eq}}).
Rule 4.32 (Coherence verdict map).
If admissibility fails (domain/branch/gauge invalid) (\Rightarrow) FAIL.
Else if a certified lower bound exists with (\Delta_{\square}\ge \eta_{\square}) or (\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}\ge \eta_{\mathrm{eq}}) (\Rightarrow) FAIL (obstruction).
Else if a certified upper bound exists with (\Delta_{\square}\le \varepsilon_{\square}), (\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}\le \varepsilon_{\mathrm{eq}}), and all required commutation obligations close (\Rightarrow) OK (if closure conditions also hold).
Else if certified upper bounds exist within thresholds but some obligations remain open or stability hypotheses are conditional (\Rightarrow) NEAR.
Else if bounds cannot be established due to missing certificates or ambiguous gauges (\Rightarrow) AMBIG with evidence plan.
Mapping must record:
region (S),
chosen metrics,
gauge conventions,
branch declarations used.
4.2.2.2 Obstruction theory as structured FAIL/AMBIG
Obstructions are treated as certified impossibilities under allowable moves.
Definition 4.33 (Allowable adjustment class). For a claim family, define the allowable adjustment class (\mathcal A) as a pinned set of moves permitted by corridor:
gauge transforms (within declared group),
branch refinements (domain restriction, not expansion),
permitted counterterms (if and only if the corridor permits modifying the presentation; otherwise counterterms are illegal).
Definition 4.34 (Obstruction value). Given defect (\Delta) and allowable adjustments (\mathcal A), define:[\Delta^\star := \inf_{a\in\mathcal A} \Delta(a).]
Rule 4.35 (Structured obstruction outcomes).
If a certificate proves (\Delta^\star\ge \eta>0), emit FAIL with an obstruction package containing: (i) the lower bound proof, (ii) minimal incompatible assumptions, (iii) localization of failure region, (iv) explicit statement that no allowable gauge/branch adjustment resolves it.
If (\Delta^\star) cannot be bounded below or above due to missing structure (unknown group action, unknown domain), emit AMBIG with an evidence plan to determine (\Delta^\star) or to certify non-decidability under the current corridor.
Obstruction packages are addressable, replayable artifacts and participate in dependency closure as certificates.
4.2.2.3 Coherence under gauge/fiber changes
Gauge and fiber changes are representation changes constrained to preserve invariants and avoid introducing holonomy drift.
Definition 4.36 (Gauge coherence). A gauge transform (g\in G) is coherent for presentation (\mathcal P) on region (S) if:
(g\cdot S \subseteq \mathrm{Dom}),
(\Delta_{\mathrm{eq}}(\mathcal P;S)) is within tolerance (or vanishes),
the induced change in residual ledger terms is within allowed bounds,
the round-trip gauge map is stable on (S) (invertible with bounded condition number).
Definition 4.37 (Fiber coherence). In decompositions (X\cong Y\times F) where only coarse (Y) is observed, fiber changes are coherent if:
they preserve the projected observables under the corridor’s readout model, and
they preserve pinned invariants on (S),and any remaining fiber ambiguity is represented as AMBIG with CandidateSet over fiber states, unless policy permits a fiber-freezing rule with explicit certificate.
Gauge coherence rules prevent semantic drift caused by inconsistent phase conventions, frame selections, or untracked representative changes.
4.2.2.4 Duality restrictions (discrete subgroups)
Dualities may be admissible only in restricted subgroups to preserve discrete invariants.
Rule 4.38 (Discrete subgroup restriction). If a claim depends on a pinned discrete structure (L) (integrality, modular classes, combinatorial adjacency), then any duality transform (T) used in its justification must satisfy the corridor’s discrete admissibility predicate. Examples:
linear lattice transforms must lie in (\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb Z)),
symplectic lattice transforms must lie in (\mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb Z)),
modular transforms must preserve residue classes under pinned modulus.
If the predicate fails, verdict is FAIL regardless of numerical smallness of (\Delta_{\mathrm{lat}}). Approximate integrality is not admissible unless the corridor explicitly defines a relaxed lattice (e.g., quantized tolerance) and the claim is explicitly marked NEAR with ledgered quantization error.
4.2.3 Algorithms
4.2.3.1 Compute (\Delta) for commuting squares
Algorithm 4.39 (ComputeDiagramDefect). Input: commuting-square specification (\square), region (S), metric (d), corridor policy (C_{\mathrm{sym}}). Output: defect (\Delta_{\square}(S)) and diagnostics.
Steps:
Validate admissibility: ensure all compositions in the square are defined on (S) under domain/branch/gauge constraints.
Compile both paths (\pi_1,\pi_2) into replayable scripts with pinned evaluation order.
Evaluate (\pi_1(x)), (\pi_2(x)) for (x\in S) using analytic bounds or pinned deterministic test suites.
Compute defect and record maximal witness points or counterexamples where defect peaks.
Emit residual ledger entry (\ell=(\square,\Delta_{\square},\mathrm{Bound},\mathrm{Method},S,\dots)).
Pseudocode:
function ComputeDiagramDefect(square, S, metric, C):
if not admissible_square(square, S, C): return FAIL
(path1, path2) = compile_square_paths(square, C)
Delta = sup_over_S( metric(path1(x), path2(x)), method=C.method )
return (Delta, diagnostics)
4.2.3.2 Obstruction minimization / counterterm search
When the corridor permits limited adjustments, defect minimization is used to attempt NEAR/OK outcomes; otherwise, minimization is used only to localize obstruction.
Algorithm 4.40 (MinimizeDefectUnderAllowableMoves). Input: defect functional (\Delta(a)), allowable adjustment set (\mathcal A), region (S), budget. Output: either (i) an adjusted artifact with certified bound, or (ii) obstruction evidence plan, or (iii) obstruction lower bound.
Allowed move classes may include:
gauge change within a pinned finite family,
branch refinement by domain restriction,
insertion of intermediate adjacent rotations (when corridor allows),
permitted counterterms (only if the corridor explicitly permits modifying the law and requires a MIGRATE/INST record).
Steps:
Enumerate discrete adjustments deterministically; if continuous, define a pinned optimization problem with deterministic solver and bounded iterations.
For each candidate adjustment (a), compute admissibility and defect bounds with fixed evaluation method.
Select minimal-defect candidate by deterministic tie-break rules.
If minimal defect (\le\varepsilon) and all coherence obligations close, output NEAR/OK evidence.
If a certified lower bound proves minimal defect (\ge\eta), output FAIL obstruction package.
Otherwise output AMBIG with a finite evidence plan for improved bounds or expanded test regime.
4.2.3.3 Discrete subgroup detection and enforcement
Algorithm 4.41 (EnforceDiscreteAdmissibility). Input: transform (T) (possibly represented by matrix (A) or combinatorial map), pinned discrete structure (L), corridor predicate. Output: admissibility verdict and lattice-preservation evidence.
Checks:
Structural check: verify (T) is of the correct type (linear, symplectic, modular, combinatorial).
Exact check: if (T) has exact representation (matrix with integer entries), verify membership in required group (determinant (\pm1), symplectic condition, etc.).
If exact representation unavailable, evaluate (\Delta_{\mathrm{lat}}(T;L_S)) on a pinned test subset (L_S) and apply corridor rule:
if corridor requires exact membership, return FAIL,
if corridor allows relaxed lattice, return NEAR with quantization ledger and required bound certificates.
Enforcement emits a lattice-preservation certificate obligation when exact membership cannot be proven but is required.
4.2.3.4 Coherence audits (phase conventions, frames)
Algorithm 4.42 (CoherenceAudit). Input: a set of morphisms/transforms used in a claim, corridor (C_{\mathrm{sym}}), region (S). Output: audit record and obligations.
Audit checks:
Phase convention coherence: verify pinned phase choices are consistent across all paths in commuting diagrams; detect mismatches that cause diagram defect.
Frame coherence: verify basis/frame selections align with declared gauge-fixing objects and that changes are recorded as gauge transforms with invertibility certificates.
Branch coherence: verify branch tags for multivalued primitives are consistent across paths.
Holonomy coherence: compute holonomy residuals for pinned loop families; flag drift above thresholds.
Outputs:
a sorted list of coherence violations,
minimal modifications to restore coherence (pin phase, unify frame, refine domain),
generated obligations with evidence plans.
4.2.4 Certificates
4.2.4.1 Equivariance failure cert
An equivariance failure certificate establishes an obstruction or failure of symmetry preservation.
Contents:
group generator set (\mathcal G), region (S), metric (d_{\mathbb V}),

Contents:
duality transform definition and type,
domain/branch admissibility on region (S),
symmetry intertwinement conditions,

defect bounds for commuting obligations required by the duality use.
4.3 Cloud — Uncertainty, identifiability, and NEAR discipline
4.3.1 Objects
4.3.1.1 Probabilistic error models and estimators
Uncertainty is modeled explicitly as part of corridor truth.
Definition 4.43 (Error model). An error model is a record[\mathcal E := (\mathrm{NoiseType},\ \mathrm{Assumptions},\ \mathrm{Parameters},\ \mathrm{EstimatorClass},\ \mathrm{ValidityRegion},\ \mathrm{Meta})]describing:
stochastic noise (Gaussian, sub-Gaussian, sub-exponential, heavy-tailed, bounded),
dependence (i.i.d., mixing, martingale, adversarial contamination),
estimator class (mean, median-of-means, M-estimators, trimmed estimators),
assumptions required for concentration bounds.
Definition 4.44 (Estimator object). An estimator is a function[\widehat{\theta} := \mathrm{Est}(D;\ \omega)]mapping data (D) (and possibly randomness (\omega)) to an estimate. Any randomness must be pinned by content-addressed seeds; otherwise the estimator is inadmissible for certification.
Estimators are tied to presentations through likelihood-to-residual compilation and through residual evaluation pipelines; their admissibility depends on domain validity and on the corridor’s accepted error model.
4.3.1.2 Confidence intervals as bound certificates
Confidence bounds are treated as certificates that populate residual ledgers.
Definition 4.45 (Confidence bound certificate). A confidence bound certificate is a record[\mathcal C := (\mathrm{Quantity},\ \widehat{q},\ [q^{-},q^{+}],\ \alpha,\ \mathrm{Assumptions},\ \mathrm{Method},\ \mathrm{ReplayPtr})]asserting[\mathbb P(q\in[q^{-},q^{+}]) \ge 1-\alpha]under pinned assumptions and pinned method. Confidence bounds are admissible only if:
the assumptions are explicitly stated,
the method is deterministic given pinned randomness,
the bound is composable under corridor rules (4.3.2.4).
Confidence certificates can support NEAR (bounded approximation), but do not by themselves support OK unless the corridor defines OK in probabilistic terms and all assumptions are certified.
4.3.1.3 Identifiability ridges and alias cones
Identifiability failures and near-failures are formalized geometrically in parameter space.
Definition 4.46 (Identifiability map). Let (\theta\in\Theta) parameterize models and let (\mathcal O(\theta)) be the induced observable law or sufficient statistic under pinned readout. Identifiability concerns injectivity of (\mathcal O) (modulo symmetry).
Definition 4.47 (Aliasing cone). An aliasing cone at (\theta) is a set (A_\theta\subseteq \Theta) such that:[\forall \theta'\in A_\theta:\ d_{\mathrm{obs}}\big(\mathcal O(\theta),\mathcal O(\theta')\big) \le \tau,]for a pinned observable metric (d_{\mathrm{obs}}) and tolerance (\tau). If (\tau=0), (A_\theta) is an exact alias class; if (\tau>0), it is a near-alias class forcing AMBIG or NEAR depending on corridor semantics.
Definition 4.48 (Identifiability ridge). A ridge is a subset (R\subseteq\Theta) along which the observable map is flat or ill-conditioned:[|D\mathcal O(\theta) v|\approx 0 \text{ for many directions }v,]or equivalently the Fisher information or Jacobian has small singular values. Ridges are recorded as structural reasons for AMBIG/NEAR and must be included in EvidencePlans.
4.3.1.4 Risk metrics for inference moves
Inference moves carry risk; corridor truth must account for risk explicitly rather than implicitly.
Definition 4.49 (Risk vector). A risk vector is:[R := (R_{\mathrm{bias}},\ R_{\mathrm{var}},\ R_{\mathrm{tail}},\ R_{\mathrm{shift}},\ R_{\mathrm{ident}},\ R_{\mathrm{model}},\ R_{\mathrm{comp}}),]capturing:
estimator bias risk,
variance risk,
tail/heavy-tail risk,
distribution shift risk,
identifiability/aliasing risk,
model mismatch risk,
computational approximation risk.
Risk vectors are stored in the ledger and are mapped into corridor truth by pinned thresholds: high identifiability risk forces AMBIG; high tail risk may force NEAR or AMBIG; high model mismatch risk may force FAIL for strict corridors.
4.3.2 Calculus
4.3.2.1 A priori vs a posteriori bounds
Uncertainty is managed by two complementary bound systems.
Definition 4.50 (A priori bound). An a priori bound is derived before observing realized data, relying on model assumptions and algorithm properties (e.g., convergence rates, stability constants). A priori bounds are used to justify solver templates and to set budgets.
Definition 4.51 (A posteriori bound). An a posteriori bound is derived from realized computations and data (e.g., residual estimators, observed gradients, empirical mixing). A posteriori bounds are used to certify NEAR outcomes and to trigger refinement.
Rule 4.52 (Promotion discipline). Promotion from AMBIG to NEAR or from NEAR to OK may rely on a posteriori bounds only if the corridor permits empirical certification and the bound methods are pinned and replayable. A priori bounds alone may justify admissibility but do not justify OK without closure evidence.
4.3.2.2 Concentration and tail-to-smoothness boundaries
Tail behavior governs which corridors are admissible.
Definition 4.53 (Tail regime). A tail regime is a classification of random variables/estimators into:
bounded,
sub-Gaussian,
sub-exponential,
heavy-tailed with finite (p)-moment,
adversarially contaminated.
Corridor policy pins acceptable tail regimes for OK and NEAR. When tails are heavier than permitted, verdict must downgrade.
Rule 4.54 (Tail-to-smoothness boundary). If a bound certificate requires smoothness assumptions (finite variance, finite exponential moment) and the tail regime certificate cannot support them, then:
any NEAR bound based on such assumptions is invalid,
evaluation must return AMBIG with an evidence plan to establish tail properties or to switch to robust estimators compatible with heavy tails.
4.3.2.3 Bias/variance split as corridor bookkeeping
Bias/variance bookkeeping is explicit ledger structure.
Definition 4.55 (Bias/variance decomposition). For an estimator (\widehat{q}) of quantity (q):[\mathbb E[(\widehat{q}-q)^2] = \mathrm{Bias}(\widehat{q})^2 + \mathrm{Var}(\widehat{q}),]under pinned assumptions. When distribution shift exists, add a shift term.
Rule 4.56 (Corridor bookkeeping). A corridor that permits NEAR inference must specify:
allowed bias budget,
allowed variance budget,
allowed tail risk budget,
allowed shift budget,and a composition rule for combining them across pipelines.
Any bound certificate included in NEAR payload must specify whether it bounds bias, variance, or both, and how it composes.
4.3.2.4 Composition of probabilistic certificates
Probabilistic certificates compose under pinned combination rules.
Rule 4.57 (Confidence composition). If certificates (\mathcal C_1,\ldots,\mathcal C_m) assert events (E_i) with failure probabilities (\alpha_i), then a conservative composition is the union bound:[\mathbb P\Big(\bigcap_{i=1}^m E_i\Big) \ge 1-\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i.]Alternative compositions (Bonferroni, multiplicative bounds) are admissible only if pinned and assumptions justify them.
Rule 4.58 (Propagation composition). For uncertainty propagation through transformations, composition uses pinned distortion constants:[\mathrm{Err}{\mathrm{out}} \le L\ \mathrm{Err}{\mathrm{in}} + \mathrm{ApproxTerms},]with all terms certified.
Rule 4.59 (Identifiability composition). If any stage introduces aliasing cones larger than corridor tolerance, the composite claim must be AMBIG unless the claim is rephrased to target equivalence classes instead of point parameters.
4.3.3 Algorithms
4.3.3.1 Residual estimators (adaptive refinement triggers)
Residual estimators are used to decide whether refinement is required and whether NEAR bounds tighten sufficiently.
Algorithm 4.60 (ComputeResidualEstimator). Input: presentation (\mathcal P), computed solution/iterate (x), data (D), corridor (C). Output: a posteriori residual estimate (\widehat{\mathrm{Res}}) and indicators (\eta).
Stages:
Evaluate residual (\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}(x)) by pinned pipeline.
Compute local indicators (\eta_i) (e.g., elementwise error indicators, gradient norms, constraint violations) pinned by solver family.
Determine refinement triggers by comparing (\eta_i) to corridor thresholds.
Emit ledger entries and, when triggered, generate obligations for refinement certificates (e.g., stability, contraction, mixing).
4.3.3.2 Robust statistics pipeline for noisy data
Robust evaluation is a standard pipeline to ensure corridor claims remain valid under heavy tails or contamination.
Algorithm 4.61 (RobustStatsPipeline). Input: data (D), estimator family, tail regime policy. Output: robust estimate, robust bound, diagnostics.
Stages:
Determine tail regime certificate availability; if absent, default to robust estimator compatible with heavy tails.
Compute robust estimator (median-of-means, trimmed mean, Huber M-estimator) with pinned parameters.
Compute bound certificate consistent with tail regime (e.g., Catoni-style bounds).
Compute diagnostics (outlier fraction, influence function stability, shift tests).
Map diagnostics into risk vector and corridor truth implications.
4.3.3.3 Identifiability tests and evidence plans
Identifiability tests determine whether a parameter claim can be unique or must remain set-valued.
Algorithm 4.62 (TestIdentifiability). Input: model map (\mathcal O(\theta)), observable metric (d_{\mathrm{obs}}), region (\Theta_0), corridor thresholds. Output: identifiability verdict and EvidencePlan if needed.
Mechanisms:
Local sensitivity: compute Jacobian/Fisher information proxies and detect small singular values.
Global alias tests: search for distinct (\theta') with small (d_{\mathrm{obs}}(\mathcal O(\theta),\mathcal O(\theta'))) using deterministic optimization/sampling (pinned).
Symmetry factoring: quotient by known symmetries; if uniqueness holds only modulo symmetry, represent results as equivalence classes.
If identifiability cannot be decided within budget, emit AMBIG with plan specifying additional observables or experimental interventions.
4.3.3.4 NEAR ledger automation
NEAR is operationalized by automated ledger management ensuring no hidden assumptions.
Algorithm 4.63 (AutomateNearLedger). Input: claim (K), corridor (C), computations and certificates. Output: VNF ledger (\mathcal L) and obligations (\mathcal O).
Rules:
Every approximation term (numerical tolerance, truncation, sampling error, model mismatch surrogate) is recorded as a ledger entry.
Every missing certificate required to justify a bound is converted into an obligation with evidence plan.
Composite bounds are computed by corridor algebra; missing terms force AMBIG rather than silently assumed.
Ledger entries are normalized and sorted; hash of ledger is included in the verdict payload to ensure stability under replay.
4.3.4 Certificates
4.3.4.1 A priori convergence certs
A priori convergence certificates justify algorithmic convergence under pinned assumptions.
Contents:
convergence rate statement (e.g., (\mathcal O(h^p)), geometric convergence, mixing time bounds),
assumptions and admissibility conditions,
proof or pinned reference with EXTERNAL fingerprint,
mapping to corridor budgets.
A priori certs support admissibility and planning; they do not alone imply OK.
4.3.4.2 A posteriori residual certs
A posteriori residual certificates provide realized error bounds based on computed residual estimators.
Contents:
computed residual value and bound type (upper bound, interval),
method and replay transcript,
region and domain validity checks,
stability conditions (condition numbers, Lipschitz constants) needed to interpret residual as proximity to a true solution.
These certs are central to NEAR and to promotion to OK when combined with closure and stability certificates.
4.3.4.3 Tail-bound certs
Tail-bound certificates certify the tail regime required by the corridor.
Contents:
tail classification result,
moment bounds or exponential moment bounds where required,
contamination model bounds (Huber (\epsilon)-contamination) if relevant,
compatibility statement linking tail regime to chosen estimators and bound methods.
Tail cert failure forces downgrade or requires switching to robust estimators with compatible certificates.
4.3.4.4 Identifiability/ambiguity certs
These certificates either prove identifiability (possibly modulo symmetry) or certify ambiguity.
Identifiability cert includes:
region (\Theta_0),
symmetry quotient used,
sensitivity bounds or injectivity proof,
explicit statement of uniqueness conditions.
Ambiguity cert includes:
aliasing cone or equivalence class description,
CandidateSet representation for ambiguity,
EvidencePlan to reduce ambiguity (additional observables or constraints) or to formalize results as set-valued outcomes.
4.4 Fractal — Stability and contraction under recursion
4.4.1 Objects
4.4.1.1 Contraction factors and defect energies
Recursive procedures are evaluated by contraction and energy decay.
Definition 4.64 (Defect energy). A defect energy is a nonnegative functional (E) assigned to an iteration state (z) such that (E(z)=0) exactly at desired fixed points or satisfaction sets. Examples include residual norms, commutator defects, diagram defects, or Lyapunov functionals.
Definition 4.65 (Contraction factor). An iterative map (F) is contractive on region (S) with factor (\kappa\in(0,1)) if:[d(F(x),F(y)) \le \kappa, d(x,y)\quad \forall x,y\in S,]in a pinned metric (d). Alternatively, energy contraction is:[E(F(z)) \le \kappa, E(z).]
Contraction factors are stored as objects in ledgers and used as promotion evidence (4.4.2.1).
4.4.1.2 Multigrid/RG operators as corridor maps
Multiscale recursion is modeled by corridor maps that define admissible operations between scales and representations.
Definition 4.66 (Corridor map). A corridor map is a transform or operator (M) together with a corridor policy specifying:
admissible region,
defect metrics and tolerances,
required certificates for stability,
budget consumption rules.
Multigrid operators (restriction/prolongation, smoothers, coarse corrections) and RG maps are corridor maps whose composition is governed by budget algebra and closure predicates.
4.4.1.3 Fixed-point anchors (“snap targets”)
Fixed points serve as anchors that stabilize recursion and enable canonicalization.
Definition 4.67 (Snap target). A snap target is a fixed-point object:[z^\star \in Z,\quad F(z^\star)=z^\star,]equipped with:
admissible neighborhood (U),
contraction data (\kappa) on (U),
invariant suite that must be preserved along iteration,
a pinned stopping criterion for certification.
Snap targets are used to certify that recursive sequences converge in a controlled manner and that NEAR outcomes can be upgraded when defect energy decays below thresholds.
4.4.1.4 Universality invariants under coarse-grain
Universality invariants are stable descriptors preserved under coarse-graining and recursion.
Definition 4.68 (Universality invariant suite). A universality suite is a set of quantities ({I_j}) such that:
each (I_j) is defined at multiple scales (\epsilon),
under coarse-graining (R_\epsilon), the induced invariants remain equal or converge under pinned tolerances:[d(I_j^{\epsilon_{k+1}}, I_j^{\epsilon_k}) \le b_k,\quad b_k\downarrow 0.]Examples include critical exponents, normalized spectra, conserved charges, and invariant distributions under rescaling.
Universality invariants support equivalence claims across scales under Fractal corridors.
4.4.2 Calculus
4.4.2.1 Contractivity (\to) convergence (\to) OK upgrade rules
Contraction provides a formal route for upgrading truth values.
Rule 4.69 (Geometric decay implies bound). If energy contraction holds:[E(z_{n}) \le \kappa^n E(z_0),\quad 0<\kappa<1,]then for any tolerance (\tau>0), choosing[n \ge \frac{\log(\tau/E(z_0))}{\log \kappa}]guarantees (E(z_n)\le \tau).
Rule 4.70 (Contraction-based promotion). Let a claim’s NEAR status be supported by a residual ledger term (E(z_n)\le \varepsilon) and open obligations related to convergence. If:
a contraction certificate proves contractivity on the iteration region,
replay certifies the iteration reached (z_n) under pinned kernel,
all closure obligations are satisfied,then the corridor may promote (\mathrm{NEAR}\to\mathrm{OK}) when (E(z_n)) meets the OK threshold and all invariants are preserved.
Promotion requires that contraction and admissibility conditions are part of the corridor policy; otherwise contraction evidence remains a NEAR justification only.
4.4.2.2 Universality under coarse-grain as equivalence rule
Fractal corridors interpret equivalence through stable observables across scales.
Rule 4.71 (Universality equivalence). Two presentations (\mathcal P,\mathcal Q) are Fractal-equivalent on scale ladder (\mathcal E) if:
for each (\epsilon\in\mathcal E), coarse-grained projections (\mathcal P_\epsilon,\mathcal Q_\epsilon) are equivalent on pinned observables,
twist defects measuring noncommutation of coarse-grain and rotation are within tolerance,
universality invariants match within scale-dependent budgets.
Fractal equivalence may support NEAR or OK depending on corridor strictness and whether invariants are exact or bounded.
4.4.2.3 Scale-dependent budgets and tightening schedules
Budgets tighten systematically under refinement and deep recursion.
Definition 4.72 (Tightening schedule). A tightening schedule is a function[\epsilon \mapsto B(\epsilon)]mapping scale to budget vector, with monotone tightening:[B_{\mathrm{def}}(\epsilon_{k+1}) \le B_{\mathrm{def}}(\epsilon_k),\quadB_{\mathrm{unc}}(\epsilon_{k+1}) \le B_{\mathrm{unc}}(\epsilon_k),]and corresponding increases in required certificates.
Schedules are pinned by corridor policy and must be included in VNF payloads for recursive claims.
4.4.2.4 Failure modes of recursion (explosion, false closure)
Recursion can fail in structurally distinct ways.
Definition 4.73 (Recursion explosion). Explosion occurs when defect energy fails to decrease and instead grows beyond bound, often due to noncontractivity, ill-conditioned inversions, or unstable discretization:[E(z_{n+1}) > E(z_n)\ \text{persistently}.]
Definition 4.74 (False closure). False closure occurs when recursion appears to converge due to numerical stagnation or insufficient observables, but invariants drift, holonomy appears, or twist defects reveal noncommutation. False closure is detected by:
invariant drift beyond tolerance,
holonomy residuals above thresholds,
discrepancy between a priori and a posteriori indicators,
sensitivity spikes (condition number blow-ups).
Failure modes force downgrade and may trigger quarantine escalation (4.4.3.4).
4.4.3 Algorithms
4.4.3.1 Contraction certificate computation
Algorithm 4.75 (ComputeContractionCert). Input: iterative operator (F) or multiscale step, region (S), metric (d), corridor policy. Output: contraction bound (\kappa) certificate or failure.
Methods:
analytic: derive Lipschitz bound (|DF|\le \kappa) on (S),
verified numeric: compute interval bounds for derivatives and obtain certified (\kappa),
replay test suite: estimate (\kappa) on pinned net of points and promote only if corridor permits empirical certification with safety margins.
Output includes:
region (S),
method and assumptions,
(\kappa) bound and its confidence/verification status,
replay transcript.
4.4.3.2 Adaptive multiscale route compilation
Algorithm 4.76 (CompileAdaptiveMultiscaleRoute). Input: base claim (K), scale ladder, candidate transforms, corridor budgets. Output: an admissible multiscale route or AMBIG/FAIL.
Steps:
Construct initial route using default adjacent scale steps and default gauge choices.
Compute twist defects and local defects at each step.
If any defect exceeds budget, refine route:
insert intermediate scales,
change gauge to reduce twist,
add domain guards to enforce admissibility,
switch to alternative transforms with better certified distortion constants.
Recompute ledgers; iterate within recursion budget.
If route becomes admissible within budgets and closure is possible, output route with obligations; otherwise output AMBIG with evidence plan or FAIL with minimal witness.
4.4.3.3 Fixed-point finders with defect tracking
Algorithm 4.77 (FixedPointWithDefectTracking). Input: map (F), initial (z_0), snap target (z^\star) (optional), corridor policy. Output: fixed point evidence or failure.
Steps:
Iterate (z_{n+1}=F(z_n)) under domain enforcement.
Track defect energy (E(z_n)), residuals, and invariant drift.
If contraction certificate available, predict convergence rate and stopping index.
Stop when:
(E(z_n)\le \tau_{\mathrm{OK}}) and invariants stable (\Rightarrow) OK candidate (subject to closure),
(E(z_n)\le \tau_{\mathrm{NEAR}}) (\Rightarrow) NEAR candidate with ledger,
failure mode detected (explosion, false closure) (\Rightarrow) downgrade and escalate.
All iteration steps must be replayable; any adaptive choices (step sizes, refinement choices) must be pinned by deterministic rules or recorded as content-addressed decisions.
4.4.3.4 Quarantine escalation for unstable recursion
Algorithm 4.78 (EscalateQuarantine). Input: recursion run transcript, defect and invariant ledgers, corridor thresholds. Output: quarantine record and obligations.
Triggers:
detected explosion beyond threshold,
holonomy drift beyond threshold,
twist defects exceeding tolerance persistently,
repeated oscillation between candidate routes without progress,
sensitivity blow-up indicating ill-posed inversion.
Outputs:
quarantine record with minimal witness set reproducing instability,
constraints on downstream usage (block promotion to OK),
evidence plan for remediation (tighten domain, change transforms, increase resolution, add certificates).
Quarantine escalation is mandatory: unstable recursion may not be used as justification for any OK claim.
4.4.4 Certificates
4.4.4.1 Multigrid/RG contraction certs
These certificates prove contraction for multiscale maps:
smoothers reduce high-frequency components,
coarse correction reduces low-frequency components,
overall step contracts in a pinned norm or energy metric.
Certificate contents:
definition of norm/energy,
region and scale range,
contraction factor bound (\kappa<1),
proof method and replay transcript,
compatibility with tightening schedule.
4.4.4.2 Universality certs
Universality certificates establish Fractal equivalence across scales.
Contents:
observable sets at each scale,
defect bounds (\Delta_\epsilon\le\varepsilon_\epsilon),
twist commutator bounds ensuring coherence between scale and rotation,
universality invariant suite match with convergence bounds,
explicit scope of equivalence (what is claimed and what is not).
4.4.4.3 Stable fixed-point (snap) certs
Snap certificates establish convergence to a fixed point with stable invariants.
Contents:
fixed point (z^\star) or certified approximate fixed point,
contraction neighborhood and factor (\kappa),
defect energy decay evidence,
invariant drift bounds,
stopping criterion satisfaction,
replay transcript and kernel pinning.
Stable fixed-point certs are the canonical bridge from NEAR to OK for recursive constructions.
4.4.4.4 Recursion safety certs
Recursion safety certificates assert that recursion is admissible and will not produce false closure under pinned conditions.
Contents:
domain invariance under iteration,
bounds preventing blow-up (energy barriers, stability regions),
holonomy/twist monitoring guarantees (loop budgets and thresholds),

CHAPTER 4 — CORRIDOR POLICIES & TRUTH LATTICE (Addr ⟨0003⟩₄)
Chapter 5 — The MyceliumGraph Kernel: LinkEdges, Kinds, Replays (Addr ⟨0010⟩₄)
5.1 Square — LinkEdge as a record type
5.1.1 Objects
5.1.1.1 LinkEdge schema fields and constraints
The MyceliumGraph is the canonical kernel object that encodes all meaning transfer, dependency, implementation binding, and certification within the corpus.
Definition 5.1 (MyceliumGraph). The kernel graph is a directed multigraph[\mathcal G := (V,E),]where:
(V) is the set of atoms, each identified by a GlobalAddr in canonical normal form (Chapter 1),
(E) is the set of LinkEdges, each identified by a content-addressed EdgeID in canonical normal form.
Definition 5.2 (LinkEdge). A LinkEdge is an immutable record:[e := (\mathrm{EdgeID},\ \mathrm{Kind},\ \mathrm{Src},\ \mathrm{Dst},\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{CorridorID},\ \mathrm{WitnessPtr},\ \mathrm{ReplayPtr},\ \mathrm{Payload},\ \mathrm{EdgeVer}).]Field semantics:
(\mathrm{EdgeID}): content-addressed identifier computed from canonical header and payload commitment (5.1.1.2).
(\mathrm{Kind}\in\mathcal K): edge kind drawn from the closed basis:[\mathcal K := {\mathrm{REF},\mathrm{EQUIV},\mathrm{MIGRATE},\mathrm{DUAL},\mathrm{GEN},\mathrm{INST},\mathrm{IMPL},\mathrm{PROOF},\mathrm{CONFLICT}}.]
(\mathrm{Src},\mathrm{Dst}\in V): source and destination GlobalAddrNFs.
(\mathrm{Scope}\in{\mathrm{INTRA},\mathrm{INTER},\mathrm{EXTERNAL}}): scope typing (Chapter 1); EXTERNAL implies pinned external fingerprint obligations.
(\mathrm{CorridorID}): content hash of the corridor policy under which the edge is asserted and certified (Chapter 4).
(\mathrm{WitnessPtr}): pointer to the witness artifact set justifying the edge (proof objects, tests, diffs, residual ledgers, minimal witness sets), in canonical pointer normal form (5.3.1.2).
(\mathrm{ReplayPtr}): pointer to deterministic replay transcript(s) required to reproduce and verify the edge (5.3.1.1).
(\mathrm{Payload}): typed payload determined by (\mathrm{Kind}), in canonical payload normal form (5.1.1.3).
(\mathrm{EdgeVer}): edge schema version; changes to schema never mutate existing edges—new edges are emitted with new (\mathrm{EdgeVer}).
Invariant 5.3 (Immutability). A LinkEdge is immutable: any modification to any field or any referenced witness/replay artifact induces a new EdgeID and therefore a new edge record. Historical edges remain addressable for regression and reproducibility.
Invariant 5.4 (Referential integrity). For (\mathrm{Scope}\in{\mathrm{INTRA},\mathrm{INTER}}), (\mathrm{Src}) and (\mathrm{Dst}) must resolve to existing atoms in the corpus index; for EXTERNAL, (\mathrm{Dst}) may be an external reference record, but must include a fingerprint commitment (5.1.1.4).
Invariant 5.5 (Corridor pinning). Every edge is asserted under exactly one corridor policy. If the same semantic edge is asserted under multiple corridors, it is represented as multiple edges with different CorridorIDs; no edge may implicitly inherit corridor settings from context.
5.1.1.2 EdgeID construction and canonical headers
Edge identity is content-addressed to guarantee deterministic reconstruction, stable regression, and non-ambiguous provenance.
Definition 5.6 (Edge header normal form). The canonical header is:[\mathrm{HdrNF}(e):=(\mathrm{Kind},\ \mathrm{SrcNF},\ \mathrm{DstNF},\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{CorridorID},\ \mathrm{EdgeVer},\ \mathrm{PayloadType},\ \mathrm{WitnessCommit},\ \mathrm{ReplayCommit}),]where:
(\mathrm{SrcNF},\mathrm{DstNF}) are GlobalAddr in canonical string NF,
(\mathrm{PayloadType}) is a kind-specific enum describing payload schema variant,
(\mathrm{WitnessCommit}) is a content hash of the witness pointer manifest (not the full witness bodies),
(\mathrm{ReplayCommit}) is a content hash of the replay pointer manifest.
Definition 5.7 (Payload commitment). (\mathrm{PayloadHash}:=\mathrm{Hash}(\mathrm{PayloadNF})), computed over the canonical payload normal form.
Definition 5.8 (EdgeID). The EdgeID is:[\mathrm{EdgeID}:=\mathrm{Hash}\big(\mathrm{HdrNF}\ \Vert\ \mathrm{PayloadHash}\big),]with (\mathrm{Hash}) pinned by kernel configuration (algorithm identifier + version), and (\Vert) denoting canonical concatenation.
Invariant 5.9 (ID determinism). Given identical (\mathrm{HdrNF}) and (\mathrm{PayloadNF}), EdgeID must be identical across all environments. Canonicalization is required before hashing; byte-level stability is achieved by canonical serialization (Appendix D).
Invariant 5.10 (Header/payload separation). Any change to payload content changes PayloadHash and thus EdgeID; any change to corridor or pointer commitments changes header and thus EdgeID; therefore provenance and policy are inseparable from identity.
5.1.1.3 Payload typing by Kind
Payloads are kind-typed. Each kind has a closed payload schema; payloads that do not conform are invalid.
Definition 5.11 (PayloadNF). (\mathrm{PayloadNF}) is a kind-dependent canonical record:
REF payload:[\mathrm{PayloadNF}_{\mathrm{REF}} := (\mathrm{RefRole},\ \mathrm{ReqLevel},\ \mathrm{DepKinds},\ \mathrm{NotesHash}),]where:
RefRole ∈ {DEF-DEP, THM-DEP, ALG-DEP, CERT-DEP, CITATION, META},
ReqLevel ∈ {REQUIRED, OPTIONAL},
DepKinds declares which downstream dependencies are induced by this REF under corridor closure.
MIGRATE payload:[\mathrm{PayloadNF}_{\mathrm{MIGRATE}} := (\mathrm{FromEdition},\ \mathrm{ToEdition},\ \mathrm{FromAddr},\ \mathrm{ToAddr},\ \mathrm{RuleID},\ \mathrm{MonotoneLineID},\ \mathrm{CompatFlags}),]where:
RuleID pins migration semantics,
MonotoneLineID identifies the monotone versionline (5.1.2.2),
CompatFlags specify alias policy and backward resolution guarantees.
IMPL payload:[\mathrm{PayloadNF}_{\mathrm{IMPL}} := (\mathrm{SpecAddr},\ \mathrm{ImplArtifactRef},\ \mathrm{InterfaceNF},\ \mathrm{BuildNF},\ \mathrm{RuntimeNF},\ \mathrm{TestSuiteRef},\ \mathrm{DeterminismPolicy}),]binding a specification atom to an implementation artifact with reproducible build and interface commitments.
PROOF payload:[\mathrm{PayloadNF}_{\mathrm{PROOF}} := (\mathrm{ClaimAddr},\ \mathrm{ProofArtifactRef},\ \mathrm{LemmaList},\ \mathrm{AssumptionsNF},\ \mathrm{ProofCheckerNF},\ \mathrm{ResultNF}),]binding a claim/theorem to a proof object and checker configuration.
EQUIV payload:[\mathrm{PayloadNF}_{\mathrm{EQUIV}} := (\mathrm{TransformRef},\ \mathrm{RegionNF},\ \mathrm{InvariantSuite},\ \mathrm{DefectSpec},\ \mathrm{BudgetNF},\ \mathrm{NormalFormMap}),]expressing equivalence via a typed transport map plus invariants and defect bounds.
DUAL payload:[\mathrm{PayloadNF}_{\mathrm{DUAL}} := (\mathrm{AdjLensStep},\ \mathrm{TransformRef},\ \mathrm{BranchNF},\ \mathrm{InvariantSuite},\ \mathrm{DefectSpec}),]representing adjacent-lens swaps only (5.2.2.1).
GEN payload:[\mathrm{PayloadNF}_{\mathrm{GEN}} := (\mathrm{GeneratorSpec},\ \mathrm{OutputAddrSet},\ \mathrm{ConstraintsNF},\ \mathrm{SeedCommit},\ \mathrm{DeterminismPolicy}),]recording generative production of new atoms from pinned seed/spec.
INST payload:[\mathrm{PayloadNF}_{\mathrm{INST}} := (\mathrm{TemplateAddr},\ \mathrm{InstanceAddr},\ \mathrm{ParamBindNF},\ \mathrm{SpecializationNF}),]recording specialization/instantiation of generic content.
CONFLICT payload:[\mathrm{PayloadNF}_{\mathrm{CONFLICT}} := (\mathrm{ConflictClass},\ \mathrm{InconsistentSet},\ \mathrm{MinimalCore},\ \mathrm{ResolutionPlanID},\ \mathrm{QuarantinePolicy}),]representing contradictions without allowing logical explosion (5.1.2.4).
Payload schemas are closed; payload extensions require incrementing EdgeVer and defining a migration rule for edge schema evolution.
5.1.1.4 Scope rules and external hash pinning
Scope determines legal resolution and pinning requirements.
Rule 5.12 (Scope legality).
INTRA: Src and Dst must share ChapterID; resolution is chapter-local.
INTER: Src and Dst must share CorpusID; cross-chapter resolution is permitted; Edition policy must be explicit when editions differ.
EXTERNAL: Dst may reference external content; all external references must be hash-pinned or otherwise fingerprinted by a corridor-permitted mechanism.
Definition 5.13 (External pin record). An EXTERNAL reference must include a fingerprint record:[\mathrm{ExtPin} := (\mathrm{ExtKind},\ \mathrm{LocatorNF},\ \mathrm{Fingerprint},\ \mathrm{RetrievalPolicy},\ \mathrm{TimestampPolicy}),]where:
ExtKind ∈ {DOI, REPO-COMMIT, DATASET-HASH, ARTIFACT-HASH, URL+HASH},
Fingerprint is a content hash or authoritative identifier,
RetrievalPolicy specifies how the content is obtained and verified,
TimestampPolicy pins time dependence when relevant.
Invariant 5.14 (No unpinned external). Any EXTERNAL edge lacking a valid ExtPin is invalid under all corridors that allow OK or NEAR; it must yield AMBIG/FAIL with obligation to pin.
5.1.2 Calculus
5.1.2.1 Edge closure: REF dependency closure rules
REF edges induce dependency closure used by corridor closure predicates (Chapter 4).
Definition 5.15 (Required dependency kinds). Given corridor (C), define required dependency kinds:[\mathcal K_{\mathrm{req}}(C)\subseteq \mathcal K]and within REF payload, (\mathrm{ReqLevel}=\mathrm{REQUIRED}) selects those edges that must be included in closure.
Definition 5.16 (REF closure operator). For a root set (S_0\subseteq V), define:[\mathrm{Cl}_{\mathrm{REF}}(S_0) := \text{least fixed point of }S \mapsto S\cup {\mathrm{Dst}(e): e\in E,\ \mathrm{Src}(e)\in S,\ \mathrm{Kind}(e)=\mathrm{REF},\ \mathrm{ReqLevel}(e)=\mathrm{REQUIRED}}.]Closure is computed under scope legality and corridor requirements; unresolved targets yield obligations.
Rule 5.17 (Closure stratification). Closure is stratified by roles:
definitional closure (DEF-DEP),
theorem closure (THM-DEP),
algorithm closure (ALG-DEP),
certificate/replay closure (CERT-DEP),and each stratum may be required or optional under corridor policy.
5.1.2.2 MIGRATE semantics and monotone versionlines
MIGRATE edges define how content moves across editions without breaking semantic addressability.
Definition 5.18 (Versionline). A versionline is a partially ordered set of editions ((\mathcal E,\preceq)) with monotonic progression, together with a monotone mapping of stable addresses:[\mu:\mathcal E\times V \to V\cup{\bot},]where (\mu(e,a)=a') indicates that atom (a) in edition (e) migrates to atom (a') in a later edition. (\bot) indicates deletion or retirement, which must be explicit.
Rule 5.19 (Monotone migration). For a fixed MonotoneLineID, MIGRATE must satisfy:
forward consistency: if (a) migrates from (e_0) to (e_1) and (e_1\preceq e_2), then either (a) migrates to some (a_2) in (e_2) or is explicitly retired;
no semantic reuse: a retired address may not be reused for a different semantic atom within the same versionline.
Rule 5.20 (Alias semantics). A corridor may permit alias resolution: references to prior-edition GlobalAddr may resolve through MIGRATE mappings to the current edition if CompatFlags allow. Alias resolution must be explicit in corridor policy and recorded in closure payloads; otherwise references across editions are INTER and may be FAIL under strict corridors.
5.1.2.3 IMPL and PROOF binding semantics
IMPL and PROOF edges bind specifications to implementations and claims to proofs.
Definition 5.21 (IMPL binding). An IMPL edge asserts that an implementation artifact realizes a specification under a pinned interface and build/replay regime. Semantics:[\mathrm{IMPL}:\ \mathrm{Spec}\ \rightsquigarrow\ \mathrm{Implementation}]is admissible only if:
InterfaceNF is well-typed relative to the Spec (inputs/outputs, invariants, error modes),
BuildNF and RuntimeNF are content-addressed and replayable,
TestSuiteRef is present and corridor-required tests pass under ReplayPtr.
Definition 5.22 (PROOF binding). A PROOF edge asserts that a proof artifact establishes a claim under a pinned proof checker. Semantics:[\mathrm{PROOF}:\ \mathrm{Claim}\ \Rightarrow\ \mathrm{Theorem}]is admissible only if:
the ClaimAddr and LemmaList resolve under closure,
ProofCheckerNF is pinned and deterministic,
ResultNF records the checker output and status, with transcript commitments.
In both cases, the edge’s corridor determines whether empirical tests suffice (NEAR) or whether proof checking must be formal (OK under stricter corridors).
5.1.2.4 CONFLICT semantics (no explosion)
Contradictions are represented explicitly and do not entail logical explosion.
Definition 5.23 (Conflict class). ConflictClass enumerates structured contradiction types:
DEF-CONFLICT: competing definitions for same concept without MIGRATE/alias reconciliation,
THM-CONFLICT: incompatible theorem claims under same corridor and assumptions,
IMPL-CONFLICT: implementation fails tests claimed under IMPL edge,
EQUIV-CONFLICT: two equivalence edges disagree beyond tolerances,
POLICY-CONFLICT: corridor inconsistency or incompatible policies applied to same claim.
Rule 5.24 (Paraconsistent containment).
CONFLICT edges do not create new entailments other than “this conflict exists.”
Any claim depending on a conflicted atom or edge must be downgraded unless the corridor explicitly defines a conflict-resolution mode.
Conflict-resolution is performed by producing additional edges (e.g., CONFLICT → MIGRATE, CONFLICT → refined corridor, CONFLICT → narrowed domain) and never by deleting the conflict record.
Definition 5.25 (Minimal conflict core). MinimalCore is a minimal inconsistent subset (MIS) of edges/assumptions sufficient to reproduce the contradiction. Minimality is certified by replay-based pruning (5.2.3.4, 5.3.3.2).
5.1.3 Algorithms
5.1.3.1 EdgeBuild constructor
EdgeBuild constructs a LinkEdge in canonical form and computes EdgeID.
Algorithm 5.26 (EdgeBuild). Input: ((\mathrm{Kind},\mathrm{Src},\mathrm{Dst},\mathrm{Scope},\mathrm{CorridorID},\mathrm{WitnessPtr},\mathrm{ReplayPtr},\mathrm{Payload},\mathrm{EdgeVer})). Output: LinkEdge (e) with computed EdgeID.
Stages:
Normalize (\mathrm{Src},\mathrm{Dst}) to GlobalAddrNF; validate scope legality.
Normalize corridor identifier; validate corridor existence in registry.
Normalize WitnessPtr and ReplayPtr manifests; compute WitnessCommit and ReplayCommit.
Normalize payload to PayloadNF according to Kind; compute PayloadHash.
Construct HdrNF; compute EdgeID = Hash(HdrNF ∥ PayloadHash).
Emit immutable edge record.
Pseudocode:
function EdgeBuild(fields):
SrcNF = NF_GlobalAddr(fields.Src)
DstNF = NF_GlobalAddr(fields.Dst)
Scope = validate_scope(fields.Scope, SrcNF, DstNF)
CorridorID = NF_Corridor(fields.CorridorID)
(WNF, WCommit) = NF_PtrManifest(fields.WitnessPtr)
(RNF, RCommit) = NF_PtrManifest(fields.ReplayPtr)
PayloadNF = NF_Payload(fields.Kind, fields.Payload)
PayloadHash = Hash(PayloadNF)
HdrNF = (Kind, SrcNF, DstNF, Scope, CorridorID, EdgeVer, PayloadType(PayloadNF), WCommit, RCommit)
EdgeID = Hash(HdrNF || PayloadHash)
return LinkEdge(EdgeID, Kind, SrcNF, DstNF, Scope, CorridorID, WNF, RNF, PayloadNF, EdgeVer)
5.1.3.2 EdgeValidate checker
EdgeValidate checks structural validity, referential integrity, pointer integrity, and payload typing.
Algorithm 5.27 (EdgeValidate). Input: edge record (e), index snapshot (\mathcal I), corridor registry (\mathcal C). Output: validation verdict and diagnostics.
Checks:
Header/payload NF correctness: verify all fields are in canonical form.
Payload typing: validate payload schema for Kind; reject unknown fields.
Scope legality: INTRA/INTER constraints; EXTERNAL pin presence.
Referential integrity: Src exists; Dst exists unless EXTERNAL with valid ExtPin.
Pointer integrity: WitnessPtr and ReplayPtr manifests are valid and canonical; commitments match stored manifest hashes.
EdgeID check: recompute PayloadHash and HdrNF; verify EdgeID matches.
Corridor compatibility: confirm required corridor constraints are not violated by the edge payload (e.g., EQUIV requires DefectSpec present; IMPL requires determinism policy; PROOF requires checker NF).
5.1.3.3 Closure compilation (required dependencies)
Closure compilation computes dependency closure for a claim or module under corridor policy and produces obligation lists.
Algorithm 5.28 (CompileClosure). Input: root atom set (S_0\subseteq V), corridor (C), index (\mathcal I). Output: closure set (S), edge set (E_S), obligations (\mathcal O).
Stages:
Initialize (S:=S_0), (E_S:=\emptyset), (\mathcal O:=\emptyset).
Iteratively add required REF dependencies per corridor: for each (a\in S), include outgoing REF edges with ReqLevel REQUIRED; add destinations to (S); record edges in (E_S).
Add corridor-required auxiliary edges: required CERT/REPLAY/PROOF/IMPL edges as specified by corridor for the claim types in (S).
Resolve MIGRATE mappings if corridor allows alias resolution; otherwise treat cross-edition references as obligations.
If any required edge target is missing or ambiguous, emit obligations with EvidencePlanIDs.
Terminate at fixed point.
Closure compilation is deterministic and emits a closure artifact suitable for OK closure certificates (Chapter 4).
5.1.3.4 Graph integrity scans
Integrity scans are deterministic audits ensuring kernel invariants.
Algorithm 5.29 (GraphIntegrityScan). Input: graph (\mathcal G), corridor audit policy (C_{\mathrm{audit}}), index snapshot. Output: audit report and quarantine triggers.
Scan suites:
Address integrity: every vertex address is well-formed; uniqueness holds (Chapter 1).
Edge integrity: every edge validates (Algorithm 5.27).
Dangling references: no unresolved INTRA/INTER targets for required edges.
Schema coherence: EdgeVer compatibility and known payload types.
Conflict containment: CONFLICT edges exist for detected contradictions; conflicted regions are quarantined per policy.
Replay availability: required ReplayPtrs exist and are pinned; missing replay induces obligations.
Migration coherence: MIGRATE edges satisfy monotone versionline invariants.
Holonomy alerts: loops requiring holonomy audits are flagged for Flower scan suites (5.2, 5.4).
Audit outputs are addressable artifacts; failures produce quarantine overlays and obligations.
5.1.4 Certificates
5.1.4.1 Registry integrity cert
Registry integrity certifies the consistency of vertex and corridor registries.
Contents:
proof that all GlobalAddr in (V) are unique and well-formed,
proof that all CorridorIDs referenced by edges exist and are pinned by PolicyHash,
proof that all EdgeKinds and PayloadTypes are recognized under declared EdgeVer.
5.1.4.2 Ledger integrity cert
Ledger integrity certifies that:
residual ledgers referenced by edges are append-only and content-addressed,
all ledger entries are typed and compatible with corridor policy,
no ledger term required by a corridor is missing for NEAR/OK edges,
ledger hash commitments in payloads match stored artifacts.
5.1.4.3 Quarantine audit cert
Quarantine audit certifies that:
quarantine triggers are computed deterministically under the pinned audit corridor,
all detected conflicts, admissibility violations, or unresolved strict dependencies are recorded as quarantine overlays,
quarantined content is blocked from promoting downstream OK claims unless explicitly allowed by corridor and accompanied by additional evidence.
5.1.4.4 Kernel routing cert
Kernel routing certifies that:
closure compilation results are deterministic and complete for required dependency kinds,
route compilation over the kernel graph is deterministic given pinned tie-break laws,
any AMBIG outcome provides CandidateSet and EvidencePlan sufficient for resolution or formal abstention.
5.2 Flower — DUAL, EQUIV, and adjacency discipline
5.2.1 Objects
5.2.1.1 DUAL swaps as adjacent lens moves
DUAL is the primitive edge kind for adjacent-lens movement in the atlas.
Definition 5.30 (Adjacency). Lens labels form a pinned cyclic adjacency:[\mathrm{Adj}(\ell_1,\ell_2)\iff \ell_1,\ell_2\text{ are adjacent in the atlas cycle}.]
Definition 5.31 (DUAL edge). A DUAL edge is a LinkEdge of kind DUAL whose payload includes:
AdjLensStep = ((\ell\to\ell')) with (\mathrm{Adj}(\ell,\ell')),
TransformRef referencing an admissible transform object (Chapter 3),
BranchNF and RegionNF specifying admissible domains,
InvariantSuite and DefectSpec specifying coherence guarantees.
Invariant 5.32 (Adjacency-only). Any DUAL edge with non-adjacent lens step is invalid. Non-adjacent swaps must be represented by a sequence of adjacent DUAL edges; equivalence of alternative factorizations must be justified by commuting-diagram witnesses (5.2.1.3).
5.2.1.2 EQUIV payloads: maps + invariants + budgets
EQUIV encodes “same law” claims under typed transport with bounded defects and pinned invariants.
Definition 5.33 (EQUIV edge). An EQUIV edge payload contains:
TransformRef: typed transform (T) or transform chain seed,
RegionNF: declared working region (S), including domain and branch declarations,
InvariantSuite: pinned invariants to preserve (e.g., satisfaction sets, fixed points, spectra, conserved quantities),
DefectSpec: defect metric definitions and computed bounds,
BudgetNF: corridor budgets consumed and remaining,
NormalFormMap: canonical mapping between RNF/PNF representations of the two presentations.
EQUIV edges are admissible only when:
transport is admissible on RegionNF,
invariants are certified preserved within corridor tolerances,
defects are bounded (OK/NEAR) or explicitly unresolved (AMBIG with evidence plan).
5.2.1.3 Commuting diagram artifacts as witnesses
Commuting diagrams are first-class witnesses used to certify coherence and equivalence of routes.
Definition 5.34 (Diagram witness). A diagram witness is an artifact that records:
the four corner nodes (addresses),
the four directed edges,
the two composed paths,
defect metric and bound,
domain/branch coherence conditions,
replay transcript for defect evaluation.
Diagram witnesses are mandatory for:
certifying that two different DUAL factorizations produce the same effect,
certifying route canonicalization in the atlas,
certifying symmetry coherence under gauge changes.
5.2.1.4 Holonomy loop detection records
Holonomy is recorded to detect accumulated twist and hidden assumptions.
Definition 5.35 (Holonomy record). A holonomy record includes:
loop specification (edge list),
region and branch declarations,
holonomy defect (\Delta_{\mathrm{hol}}) relative to identity,
invariant drift diagnostics,
replay transcript commitments.
Holonomy records are referenced by certificates that bound holonomy under a corridor (Chapter 3 and Chapter 4), and by quarantine triggers (5.4).
5.2.2 Calculus
5.2.2.1 Admissible swap calculus (Adj only)
The swap calculus defines legal factorization of lens permutations into adjacent steps.
Rule 5.36 (Adjacent factorization). Any requested lens swap (\ell\to \ell') must be represented by a path[\ell=\ell_0\to \ell_1\to \cdots\to \ell_m=\ell']with (\mathrm{Adj}(\ell_i,\ell_{i+1})) for all (i). The chosen factorization is canonical under a pinned tie-break law (cost first, then lexical order).
Rule 5.37 (Swap admissibility). Each step is admissible only if the corresponding DUAL transform is admissible on the declared region and the branch declarations remain consistent throughout the chain. Any mismatch forces AMBIG/FAIL.
5.2.2.2 Equivalence under symmetry constraints
EQUIV claims are constrained by declared symmetries (Chapter 2 and Chapter 3).
Rule 5.38 (Symmetry-coherent equivalence). An EQUIV edge between presentations (\mathcal P) and (\mathcal Q) is admissible under a symmetry corridor only if:
declared group actions on carriers/value spaces are compatible,
equivariance defect bounds are within corridor thresholds or an obstruction is explicitly recorded,
gauge choices are pinned and invertible where required,
invariants are symmetry-invariant observables or are accompanied by gauge-fixing conventions.
5.2.2.3 Bounded conjugacy (NEAR) vs illegal swap (FAIL)
Conjugacy may hold approximately; the corridor distinguishes acceptable approximation from illegality.
Rule 5.39 (NEAR conjugacy). A DUAL or EQUIV edge may be NEAR if:
an upper bound on defect is certified (\Delta\le \varepsilon),
all domain and branch admissibility constraints hold on region,
residual ledger records all approximation terms,
any remaining open obligations are permitted by corridor.
Rule 5.40 (Illegal swap). A swap is FAIL if:
admissibility fails (inverse undefined, branch ambiguity unpinned),
a certified lower bound exceeds thresholds ((\Delta\ge \eta)),
discrete invariants required by the claim are violated (lattice preservation failure) under corridors that require exactness.
5.2.2.4 Conflict resolution move sets
Conflicts are resolved only by explicit moves that preserve provenance and do not delete contradictions.
Definition 5.41 (Resolution move set). Allowed moves for conflict resolution include:
refining domains/branches to separate regimes,
splitting corridors (tightening policy on one branch),
introducing MIGRATE edges to reconcile definitions across versions,
introducing explicit equivalence-class semantics (set-valued outcomes) for ambiguous claims,
introducing new EQUIV edges with stronger witnesses or stricter invariants.
No move may retroactively erase an existing edge. Resolution is achieved by adding edges and quarantining superseded regimes.
5.2.3 Algorithms
5.2.3.1 Swap factorization into adjacent steps
Algorithm 5.42 (FactorizeLensSwap). Input: start lens (\ell), target lens (\ell'), corridor policy. Output: canonical adjacent path and required DUAL edges.
Steps:
Generate clockwise and counterclockwise adjacent paths.
Compute policy cost and admissibility feasibility for each (domain/branch constraints).
Choose canonical path by minimal cost; tie-break deterministically.
Output the path and obligations for missing DUAL edges or missing admissibility certificates.
5.2.3.2 Diagram construction and defect evaluation
Algorithm 5.43 (BuildAndCheckDiagram). Input: two routes (\pi_1,\pi_2) between same endpoints, region (S), defect metric and corridor. Output: commuting diagram witness or conflict packet.
Steps:
Compile both routes into replayable scripts.
Evaluate both transports on the pinned region/test regime.
Compute diagram defect (\Delta_{\square}(S)).
If (\Delta_{\square}\le \varepsilon), emit diagram witness and attach as witness to EQUIV/DUAL normalization edges.
If (\Delta_{\square}\ge \eta) with certified lower bound, emit CONFLICT payload with MinimalCore and quarantine policy.
Otherwise emit AMBIG evidence plan for tighter bounds or refined domains.
5.2.3.3 Equivalence search with invariants as filters
Algorithm 5.44 (SearchEquivalence). Input: source atom (A), target atom (B), corridor (C), invariant signatures. Output: candidate EQUIV routes or AMBIG.
Method:
Compute invariant signature vector for (A) and (B) (pinned invariants and their coarse summaries).
Filter candidate transforms/routes by compatibility with invariant signatures (reject routes that cannot preserve required invariants by type).
Search for paths in the graph using only admissible edge kinds (DUAL sequences, existing EQUIV edges, MIGRATE mappings if permitted).
Rank candidate routes by predicted defect upper bounds and corridor cost; tie-break deterministically.
Output the best route with obligations for missing witnesses, or AMBIG with CandidateSet and evidence plan if route cannot be certified.
5.2.3.4 Conflict packet minimization
Algorithm 5.45 (MinimizeConflictCore). Input: a detected contradiction involving a set of edges (S\subseteq E). Output: MinimalCore (S^\star\subseteq S).
Steps:
Verify contradiction by replay under pinned corridor.
Iteratively attempt to remove edges from (S) while preserving contradiction (greedy deterministic pruning with replay).
Output minimal core and attach replay transcript proving minimality relative to the pruning method.
Emit CONFLICT edge payload with MinimalCore and resolution plan template.
5.2.4 Certificates
5.2.4.1 Adjacency compliance cert
Certifies that:
every DUAL step is adjacent in the pinned atlas,
every non-adjacent swap is factorized into adjacent steps,
factorization is canonical under corridor tie-break laws,
domain/branch admissibility holds on the declared region for each step.
5.2.4.2 Equivalence witness cert
Certifies an EQUIV edge by providing:
transform admissibility proof,
commuting diagram witness (when route normalization or alternative derivations exist),
invariant suite verification,
defect bounds within corridor thresholds,
closure of required obligations and replay correctness.
5.2.4.3 Bounded-defect certs
Certifies NEAR or OK by:
bounding defect metrics (conjugacy defect, diagram defect, commutator defect),
recording all approximation terms in residual ledger,
bounding distortion constants required for defect propagation,
guaranteeing budget closure under corridor algebra.
5.2.4.4 Conflict quarantine cert
Certifies that:
conflict detection is reproducible and deterministic,
MinimalCore reproduces the contradiction by replay,
quarantined scope is correctly computed (which claims are blocked from OK),
resolution moves are properly constrained (no deletion, only additive repair).
5.3 Cloud — Deterministic replay and transcript commitments
5.3.1 Objects
5.3.1.1 ReplayPtr schema: kernel + NF + schedule + commitments
Replay is the mechanism that turns claims into verifiable computation.
Definition 5.46 (ReplayPtr). A ReplayPtr is a content-addressed pointer:[\mathrm{ReplayPtr} := (\mathrm{ReplayID},\ \mathrm{KernelID},\ \mathrm{NFConfigID},\ \mathrm{ScheduleNF},\ \mathrm{InputsNF},\ \mathrm{Commitments},\ \mathrm{OutputsNF},\ \mathrm{ExitStatusNF})]where:
KernelID pins executable environment (interpreter/compiler versions, libraries, numerical settings, proof checker versions),
NFConfigID pins canonicalization rules used,
ScheduleNF pins evaluation order (including loop enumeration bounds and iteration counts),
InputsNF pins all inputs (atom addresses, data artifacts, parameters, initial conditions),
Commitments includes content hashes of all referenced artifacts (including external pins),
OutputsNF records expected outputs and their hashes (including intermediate hashes when required by corridor),
ExitStatusNF records success/failure and failure localization.
ReplayPtr is valid only if:
all inputs are resolvable under scope rules,
all randomness is pinned (5.3.1.4),
outputs match commitments under verification.
5.3.1.2 WitnessPtr schema: proofs/tests/diffs/RL/MWS
Witnesses justify edges and verdicts.
Definition 5.47 (WitnessPtr). A WitnessPtr is a manifest:[\mathrm{WitnessPtr} := (\mathrm{WitnessID},\ \mathrm{WitnessList})]where WitnessList is an ordered list of witness references, each typed:
PROOF-ART: proof object references,
TEST-ART: test suite outputs,
DIFF-ART: diffs between normalized forms,
RL-ART: residual ledger artifacts,
MWS-ART: minimal witness set artifacts,
DIAG-ART: commuting diagram witnesses,
HOL-ART: holonomy records,each with content hash commitments and scope legality.
Witness manifests are canonicalized and hashed; the manifest hash is included in EdgeID header commitments (5.1.1.2).
5.3.1.3 Transcript commitments and hashing strategy
Transcripts must be tamper-evident and replay-equivalent.
Definition 5.48 (Transcript). A transcript is a sequence of steps:[\tau := (s_1,\ldots,s_m),]where each step (s_k) records:
operation identifier,
input commitments,
output commitments,
environment commitments,
timing and budget consumption records as permitted by corridor.
Rule 5.49 (Transcript hashing). A transcript commitment is computed as:[\mathrm{TrHash} := \mathrm{Hash}(\mathrm{NF}(\tau)),]where NF orders fields deterministically and includes only corridor-permitted nondeterministic fields (e.g., wall-clock time excluded unless required for budget accounting, in which case it is represented as bounded intervals rather than exact values).
The hashing strategy is hierarchical:
step hashes chain into a transcript hash,
transcript hashes are included in ReplayPtr commitments,
ReplayPtr manifest hashes are included in LinkEdge header commitments.
5.3.1.4 Randomness policy (when allowed, how pinned)
Randomness is permitted only under explicit corridor rules.
Definition 5.50 (Randomness policy). A randomness policy is:[\mathrm{RandPolicy} := (\mathrm{Allowed},\ \mathrm{PRNGID},\ \mathrm{SeedCommit},\ \mathrm{StreamNF},\ \mathrm{UsageNF})]where:
Allowed ∈ {NO, YES},
PRNGID pins the generator algorithm and version,
SeedCommit is a content hash of the seed material,
StreamNF pins how randomness is consumed (stream partitioning, per-step counters),
UsageNF pins which steps consume randomness and in what order.
Invariant 5.51 (Deterministic replay). If Allowed = NO, any randomness consumption invalidates replay; if Allowed = YES, the transcript must demonstrate identical randomness consumption order and output under replay, else the edge is invalid for OK/NEAR.
5.3.2 Calculus
5.3.2.1 Replay determinism as an invariant
Replay determinism is itself an invariant required by corridors that permit OK closure.
Invariant 5.52 (Replay equivalence). Given a ReplayPtr (R), repeated execution under the pinned KernelID and InputsNF must produce identical OutputsNF and identical TrHash. Any divergence must be represented as FAIL with a minimal witness.
Rule 5.53 (Determinism boundary). If a computation is inherently nondeterministic (parallel race, stochastic hardware, non-pinned floating mode), it is inadmissible for OK corridors; it may be admissible for NEAR only if the corridor defines a determinism relaxation (e.g., output interval bounds) and the transcript commits to those bounds.
5.3.2.2 Evidence sufficiency predicates per Kind
Each edge kind defines an evidence sufficiency predicate (S_{\mathrm{Kind}}) that maps (witnesses, replay, ledgers) to admissibility.
Definition 5.54 (Sufficiency predicate). For an edge (e) of kind (k), define:[S_k(e;C) \in {\texttt{true},\texttt{false}}]computed by corridor policy:
REF: sufficiency requires valid resolution and scope legality; witnesses optional unless REF asserts a claim beyond dependency.
IMPL: sufficiency requires tests pass under replay and interface commitments match.
PROOF: sufficiency requires proof checker acceptance under replay and lemma closure.
EQUIV/DUAL: sufficiency requires admissible transforms, invariant suite checks, defect bounds, and diagram/holonomy obligations as required.
MIGRATE: sufficiency requires monotone versionline coherence and alias rules pinned.
CONFLICT: sufficiency requires reproducible contradiction via replay and minimal core.
Sufficiency predicates are pinned by corridor policy and are included in EdgeValidate and closure computations.
5.3.2.3 Candidate route tie-break laws
When multiple routes exist for equivalence or transport, deterministic selection is required.
Rule 5.55 (Tie-break law). Candidate routes are ordered by:
minimal certified global defect bound,
minimal corridor cost (budget use),
minimal open obligations count,
lexicographic order of route EdgeIDs,
lexicographic order of intermediate node GlobalAddrNFs.
If any comparator requires unavailable data, the outcome is AMBIG with an evidence plan to obtain the missing comparator data.
5.3.2.4 AMBIG evidence plan calculus
AMBIG is constructive and must include a finite plan.
Definition 5.56 (Evidence plan calculus). An EvidencePlan is a finite directed acyclic program:[\mathrm{EvidencePlan} := (Q,\ \prec,\ \mathrm{StopRules}),]where (Q) is a set of tasks (resolve reference, compute defect bound, generate certificate, run replay, search counterexample), (\prec) is a partial order defining execution dependencies, and StopRules define termination conditions for promotion or abstention.
Rule 5.57 (Plan validity). A plan is valid only if:
every task is admissible under corridor policy,
every required external input is pinned or is explicitly created as a pinning obligation,
the plan terminates within corridor budgets or yields a formal abstention condition,
completion of the plan is sufficient to decide between a promoted verdict (NEAR/OK) and FAIL or a stable AMBIG outcome expressed as equivalence classes.
5.3.3 Algorithms
5.3.3.1 Replay executor and verifier
Algorithm 5.58 (ReplayExecuteVerify). Input: ReplayPtr (R), artifact store, corridor policy. Output: verification status and transcript hash.
Steps:
Load KernelID environment; verify environment fingerprint matches commitments.
Load InputsNF; resolve all GlobalAddr and external pins.
Execute ScheduleNF deterministically; enforce RandPolicy.
Record stepwise transcript; compute TrHash.
Compare OutputsNF hashes against committed values; verify exit status.
Emit verification artifact (PASS/FAIL) with minimal witness localization on failure.
5.3.3.2 Witness extraction from computations
Algorithm 5.59 (ExtractWitnesses). Input: computation transcript, corridor policy, target edge kind. Output: WitnessPtr manifest.
Rules:
For EQUIV/DUAL: extract defect ledgers, diagram witnesses, invariant checks, branch/domain admissibility checks.
For IMPL: extract test outputs, build logs, interface normalization diffs.
For PROOF: extract checker outputs, lemma closure list, assumption NF.
For CONFLICT: extract counterexamples, minimal inconsistency core, replay reproduction.
Witness extraction is deterministic: given the same transcript and policy, it yields identical WitnessPtr manifest and commitments.
5.3.3.3 Deterministic route compiler
Algorithm 5.60 (CompileRoute). Input: source node (A), target node (B), allowed edge kinds (K_{\mathrm{route}}), corridor (C), invariant filters. Output: canonical route or AMBIG.
Steps:
Generate candidate paths under constraints (bounded by corridor budgets).
Filter by invariant compatibility and scope legality.
Compute certified defect upper bounds when available; otherwise generate obligations and evidence plan tasks.
Rank routes by tie-break law (5.3.2.3).
Output canonical route with replay commitments, or AMBIG with CandidateSet and evidence plan.
5.3.3.4 Regression suite runner
Algorithm 5.61 (RunRegressionSuite). Input: module or corpus snapshot, corridor (C_{\mathrm{reg}}), prior snapshot (optional). Output: regression report.
Checks:
EdgeID stability: unchanged edges retain same EdgeID; changed content produces new EdgeIDs.
Migration coherence: MIGRATE edges form monotone versionlines without semantic reuse.
Replay stability: pinned replays still pass; failures produce quarantine and obligations.
Closure stability: previously OK closures remain OK under unchanged corridors; if corridor changes, produce reclassification report.
Conflict stability: prior conflicts remain represented; no silent resolution without explicit resolution edges.
Regression outputs are sealed as artifacts referenced by certificates.
5.3.4 Certificates
5.3.4.1 Replay determinism cert
Certifies that a ReplayPtr is deterministic and reproducible:
KernelID and NFConfigID are pinned and verified,
InputsNF and external pins are fully resolved and content-addressed,
RandPolicy is either NO or fully pinned with verifiable stream usage,
transcript hash and outputs are stable under repeated runs.
5.3.4.2 Witness sufficiency cert
Certifies that a WitnessPtr manifest satisfies the sufficiency predicate for the edge kind under corridor policy:
required witness types present,
witness commitments match referenced artifacts,
proof/checker/test outputs satisfy corridor thresholds,
residual ledgers cover all required defect terms.
5.3.4.3 Route uniqueness cert (or AMBIG)
Certifies that a compiled route is the unique canonical route under corridor tie-break law, or returns AMBIG with:
CandidateSet of competing routes,
missing comparator data obligations,
evidence plan to obtain data and decide uniqueness or to formalize the result as a set-valued transport.
5.3.4.4 Regression stability cert
Certifies stability across versions:
previously sealed edges remain valid or are explicitly migrated,
replay artifacts remain valid under pinned kernels (or are explicitly version-bumped with new edges),
closure and corridor classifications are consistent under defined regression corridor.
5.4 Fractal — Graph growth, compression, and extraction
5.4.1 Objects
5.4.1.1 Seed objects for subgraphs (“modules”)
Large graphs are managed through sealed modules.
Definition 5.62 (Module). A module is a subgraph (\mathcal M=(V_M,E_M)) together with a boundary interface:[\partial\mathcal M := (\mathrm{Exports},\ \mathrm{Imports},\ \mathrm{PolicySet},\ \mathrm{Seed})]where:
Exports are designated atoms/edges meant for external reference,
Imports are required external dependencies,
PolicySet is the set of corridor policies under which the module is sealed,
Seed is a content-addressed seed object that can regenerate ((V_M,E_M)) and its indices deterministically.
Definition 5.63 (Subgraph seed). A seed contains:
root node set,
closure rule set (edge kinds included),
canonical ordering rules,
commitments to all included edges and witnesses,
expansion recipe and replay harness requirements.
5.4.1.2 Summaries as coarse nodes with expansion edges
Summaries are coarse representations that preserve interfaces while compressing internal structure.
Definition 5.64 (Summary node). A summary node is an atom representing a module’s exported interface and invariant signature:[S_M := (\mathrm{ModuleID},\ \mathrm{ExportSig},\ \mathrm{InvariantSig},\ \mathrm{BudgetSig},\ \mathrm{SeedCommit})]and includes explicit expansion edges:
GEN/INST edges to expand summary into detailed nodes,
REF edges to connect summary to exports and imports.
Summaries are not substitutes for proof; they are compression artifacts whose correctness is certified by module integrity and expansion closure certificates.
5.4.1.3 Dependency DAGs vs cyclic holonomy clusters
The kernel distinguishes acyclic dependency structure from cycles that represent coherence constraints.
Definition 5.65 (Dependency DAG). The dependency DAG is the subgraph induced by required REF edges under a corridor; it is typically required to be acyclic within modules, except for explicitly allowed recursion patterns that are separately certified.
Definition 5.66 (Holonomy cluster). A holonomy cluster is a strongly connected subgraph induced by DUAL/EQUIV edges (and associated commuting-diagram obligations) representing representation cycles. Holonomy clusters are audited for bounded holonomy; they are not treated as logical dependencies unless explicitly referenced.
5.4.1.4 Quarantine overlays as policy layers
Quarantine is represented as an overlay layer on the graph.
Definition 5.67 (Quarantine overlay). A quarantine overlay is a policy layer:[Q := (\mathrm{OverlayID},\ \mathrm{BlockedSet},\ \mathrm{ReasonSet},\ \mathrm{RequiredRemediation},\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{CorridorID})]where BlockedSet may include nodes and edges, and ReasonSet includes conflicts, admissibility failures, replay failures, or unstable recursion findings. Quarantine overlays are applied during closure compilation and verdict evaluation.
5.4.2 Calculus
5.4.2.1 Modularization rules under REF closure
Modules must be closed under required dependencies.
Rule 5.68 (REF-closed modularization). A module (\mathcal M) is admissible under corridor (C) only if:
for every exported node (v\in \mathrm{Exports}), the required REF closure (\mathrm{Cl}_{\mathrm{REF}}({v})) is contained in (V_M) except for explicitly declared Imports,
every Import is pinned by GlobalAddrNF or external fingerprint,
module closure artifacts list all Imports and their corridor statuses.
5.4.2.2 Graph compression with preserved proofs
Compression must preserve proof-carrying closure.
Rule 5.69 (Proof-preserving compression). A compression ( \mathrm{Comp}:\mathcal M\to S_M ) is admissible only if:
every exported claim whose OK status depends on internal proofs remains provable by expanding the seed and replaying witnesses,
the summary node includes commitments to the seed and to the module’s integrity certificates,
any omission of internal detail is recoverable via expansion edges.
5.4.2.3 Budget tightening under expansion
Expansion increases detail and may tighten budgets.
Rule 5.70 (Expansion tightening). Let (B_{\mathrm{summary}}) be the budget signature at summary resolution and (B_{\mathrm{full}}) the budget at expanded resolution. A corridor may require:[B_{\mathrm{full}} \preceq B_{\mathrm{summary}}](tighter tolerances), and expansion must not promote truth values without satisfying tightened budgets. Any promotion after expansion requires recomputation of closure and defect ledgers under the tighter corridor.
5.4.2.4 Safety against recursive explosion
Graph operations can recurse (expansion of modules, route searches, holonomy audits). Safety rules prevent unbounded explosion.
Rule 5.71 (Explosion safety). Every recursive procedure on (\mathcal G) must be governed by pinned budgets:
maximum depth for module expansion,
maximum path length for route search,
maximum loop enumeration for holonomy audits,
maximum obligation generation per claim.
If budgets are exceeded, the procedure must return AMBIG with an evidence plan that either refines the query scope or requests additional structure (e.g., added invariant signatures to prune search).
5.4.3 Algorithms
5.4.3.1 Subgraph sealing (hash-pinned module export)
Algorithm 5.72 (SealModule). Input: root set (R), corridor set ({C_i}), modularization policy. Output: sealed module (\mathcal M) with ModuleID and seed.
Steps:
Compute closure under required dependencies for all exports across corridors.
Partition into internal nodes and imports; validate imports are pinned.
Collect all edges required for proofs/replays under corridors (PROOF, IMPL, CERT, REPLAY).
Canonicalize ordering of nodes and edges; compute commitments.
Create module seed capturing expansion recipe and commitments.
Emit module integrity certificates and summary node (S_M).
Output module bundle with hash-pinned ModuleID.
5.4.3.2 Incremental rebuilds with preserved EdgeIDs
Algorithm 5.73 (IncrementalRebuild). Input: prior module/corpus snapshot, new content changes. Output: updated snapshot with preserved EdgeIDs when unchanged.
Rules:
Recompute EdgeIDs only for edges whose canonical header or payload commitments change.
Preserve EdgeIDs of unchanged edges; preserve ordering invariants.
When schema versions change, emit MIGRATE or schema-migration edges rather than mutating old edges.
Run regression suite and produce delta artifacts linking old/new snapshots.
5.4.3.3 Cycle detection and holonomy reporting
Algorithm 5.74 (DetectCyclesAndReportHolonomy). Input: graph (\mathcal G), corridor holonomy policy, budgets. Output: cycle list, holonomy records, quarantine triggers.
Steps:
Identify strongly connected components in subgraphs induced by DUAL/EQUIV edges.
Enumerate loops within SCCs under loop budget.
For each loop, compile replay and compute holonomy defect and invariant drift.
Emit holonomy records; quarantine clusters exceeding thresholds.
Generate obligations for missing diagram witnesses or missing admissibility certificates.
5.4.3.4 Auto-generation of extraction indices
Algorithm 5.75 (GenerateExtractionIndices). Input: module or corpus snapshot. Output: multi-index artifacts enabling deterministic retrieval.
Indices include:
exact maps: GlobalAddrNF → payload pointer,
kind maps: Kind → edge lists,
corridor maps: CorridorID → edges under corridor,
closure indices: export node → required closure set,
witness indices: edge → witness manifest and replay pointers,
conflict indices: conflicted region → conflict packets and quarantine overlays.
All indices are canonicalized and hashed; they are included in module seeds to support deterministic expansion and retrieval.
5.4.4 Certificates
5.4.4.1 Module integrity cert
Certifies that a sealed module:
is closed under required REF dependencies except declared imports,
contains all required proofs, implementations, certificates, and replays for its exports under declared corridors,
has deterministic seed expansion that reproduces the module exactly.
5.4.4.2 Graph compression correctness cert
Certifies that summary nodes and compression:
preserve export interfaces and invariant signatures,
are expandable to full proof-carrying detail,
do not suppress obligations or conflicts,
maintain consistent corridor truth classifications under expansion.
5.4.4.3 Expansion closure cert
Certifies that expanding a module seed:
regenerates the module graph with identical node/edge commitments,
reproduces all required closure artifacts and indices,
reproduces all replay transcripts and witness manifests required for OK/NEAR exports,
respects tightening schedules and does not promote truth values without satisfying expanded corridor requirements.
5.4.4.4 Explosion-prevention cert
Certifies that recursive procedures (expansion, routing, holonomy audits) are budget-safe and deterministic:
all recursion bounds are pinned and enforced,
AMBIG outcomes are returned when bounds are exceeded,
evidence plans are finite and admissible,
no runaway growth can occur without explicit policy override recorded as a corridor change.
CHAPTER 5 — THE MYCELIUMGRAPH KERNEL: LINKEDGES, KINDS, REPLAYS (Addr ⟨0010⟩₄)
Chapter 6 — Quad-Polar Generator Basis ((D,\Omega,\Sigma,\Psi)) (Addr ⟨0011⟩₄)
6.1 Square ((D)) — Dissipative/constraint pole
6.1.1 Objects
6.1.1.1 Contractive generators and accretive operators
The (D)-pole encodes constraint enforcement, dissipation, and irreversible relaxation. Its primitive object is a generator of a contraction semigroup (or, more generally, an accretive operator inducing monotone decay of a Lyapunov functional).
Definition 6.1 (Dissipative generator, Banach form). Let ((X,|\cdot|)) be a Banach space. An operator (D:\mathrm{Dom}(D)\subseteq X\to X) is dissipative if for all (x,y\in \mathrm{Dom}(D)) and all (\lambda>0),[|x-y| \le |x-y+\lambda(Dx-Dy)|.](D) is (m)-dissipative if it is dissipative and (\mathrm{Range}(I-\lambda D)=X) for some (equivalently all) (\lambda>0). An (m)-dissipative operator generates a contraction semigroup ({U_t}_{t\ge 0}) on (X) with (|U_t|\le 1).
Definition 6.2 (Accretive operator, Hilbert form). Let (X) be a Hilbert space with inner product (\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle). An operator (A:\mathrm{Dom}(A)\to X) is accretive if[\mathrm{Re},\langle Ax,x\rangle \ge 0\quad\forall x\in \mathrm{Dom}(A).]It is (\alpha)-strongly accretive if (\mathrm{Re},\langle Ax,x\rangle \ge \alpha|x|^2). Setting (D:=-A), strong accretivity yields exponential contraction rates.
Definition 6.3 (Contraction semigroup). A family ({U_t}_{t\ge 0}\subset \mathcal L(X)) is a contraction semigroup if:
(U_0=I),
(U_{t+s}=U_tU_s) for (t,s\ge 0),
(\lim_{t\downarrow 0}|U_tx-x|=0) for all (x\in X),
(|U_t|\le 1) for all (t\ge 0).
The generator (D) of ({U_t}) is defined by:[Dx=\lim_{t\downarrow 0}\frac{U_tx-x}{t},\quad x\in\mathrm{Dom}(D),]and is (m)-dissipative.
Definition 6.4 (Gradient flow as (D)). Let (E:X\to(-\infty,\infty]) be a proper lower-semicontinuous convex functional on a Hilbert space (X). The subdifferential (\partial E) is maximal monotone; the evolution[\dot x(t)\in -\partial E(x(t))]is a (D)-dynamics. In smooth settings, (D(x)=-\nabla E(x)) and (\dot x=D(x)).
These definitions unify:
discrete diffusion (graph Laplacians),
PDE diffusion operators (elliptic operators),
constrained projection flows (penalty/barrier gradients),
monotone operator inclusions (variational inequalities).
6.1.1.2 State spaces: graphs/lattices/complexes/manifolds
The (D)-pole acts on carriers endowed with metric and constraint structures.
Definition 6.5 (State space classes). The admissible (D)-carriers include:
Graphs and lattices.
Vertex set (V), edge set (E), weights (w_{ij}\ge 0).
State (x:V\to\mathbb R^m) or (x\in\mathbb R^{|V|m}).
Inner product (\langle x,y\rangle = \sum_{i\in V} \langle x_i,y_i\rangle ,m_i) with vertex masses (m_i>0).
Cell complexes / simplicial complexes.
Cochain spaces (C^k), coboundary operators (d_k).
Discrete Laplacians (\Delta_k=d_{k-1}d_{k-1}^\ast+d_k^\ast d_k).
Constraint objects implemented as subcomplex restrictions or boundary chain constraints.
Manifolds.
Smooth manifold (M) with Riemannian metric (g).
State spaces (X=L^2(M)), (H^1(M)), vector fields, differential forms.
Dissipative operators such as Laplace–Beltrami (\Delta_g), divergence-form operators (\nabla\cdot(A\nabla)), and their constrained variants.
Feasible sets and constraint manifolds.
Convex sets (K\subset X), manifolds (C(x)=0), inequality sets (G(x)\le 0).
Admissible flows include projected gradient flows or barrier-based gradient flows, with explicit domain declarations (Chapter 2).
Each carrier includes:
a norm or metric,
boundary/constraint declarations,
admissibility guards ensuring operator evaluation and energy estimates remain valid.
6.1.1.3 Lyapunov/energy functionals
Energy functionals provide canonical invariants for (D)-flows (monotone decay).
Definition 6.6 (Lyapunov functional). A functional (E:X\to\mathbb R\cup{+\infty}) is Lyapunov for the flow (\dot x = D(x)) on a region (S\subseteq X) if along all admissible trajectories (x(t)\subseteq S),[\frac{d}{dt}E(x(t)) \le 0]in the appropriate derivative sense (classical, subdifferential, or weak).
Definition 6.7 (Dissipation identity). A (D)-dynamics admits a dissipation identity when there exists a nonnegative dissipation functional (\mathcal D(x)\ge 0) such that[\frac{d}{dt}E(x(t)) = -\mathcal D(x(t)).]Common cases:
(D=-\nabla E) with (\mathcal D=|\nabla E|^2),
(D=\Delta) and (E(x)=\tfrac12|x|^2) with (\mathcal D=|\nabla x|^2) (weak form).
Definition 6.8 (Energy convexity and rates). If (E) is (\lambda)-convex (in a Hilbert or metric gradient-flow sense) then dissipation implies exponential convergence under appropriate conditions:[E(x(t)) - E(x^\star) \le e^{-2\lambda t}\big(E(x(0))-E(x^\star)\big)]and contraction of trajectories.
Lyapunov objects are stored as:
explicit expressions (typed AST),
domain conditions for differentiability,
a pinned dissipation certificate method (analytic or replay-based).
6.1.1.4 Boundary/constraint objects
Constraints are not informal. They are first-class objects that change admissibility and solver compilation.
Definition 6.9 (Boundary condition object). A boundary condition object is:[\mathcal B := (\mathrm{Type},\ \Gamma,\ \mathrm{Data},\ \mathrm{TraceMap},\ \mathrm{Admissibility})]where:
Type ∈ {Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, periodic, mixed},
(\Gamma) is the boundary (or interface) where conditions apply,
Data specifies boundary values/fluxes,
TraceMap describes how states restrict to (\Gamma),
Admissibility specifies required regularity to make the condition meaningful.
Definition 6.10 (Constraint object). A constraint object is:[\mathcal C := (\mathrm{Kind},\ \mathrm{Map},\ \mathrm{Target},\ \mathrm{FeasibleSet},\ \mathrm{Projection},\ \mathrm{Barrier},\ \mathrm{Meta})]with:
Kind ∈ {Equality, Inequality, ConvexSet, Manifold, Combinatorial},
Map (C:X\to\mathbb R^k) or (G:X\to\mathbb R^k),
Target defines (C(x)=0) or (G(x)\le 0),
FeasibleSet (K\subseteq X),
Projection (P_K) (if available) and/or Barrier (B),
Meta pins enforcement mode (projected flow vs penalty vs barrier), and required certificates.
Definition 6.11 (Constrained dissipative flow). A constrained (D)-flow is specified by:
either projected dynamics: (\dot x \in \Pi_{T_K(x)}D(x)),
or penalized/barrier dynamics: (\dot x = D(x) - \nabla B(x)),with the admissible domain and branch behavior declared as part of the presentation (Chapter 2).
6.1.2 Calculus
6.1.2.1 Semigroup theory and decay laws
The calculus of (D) is semigroup-based and yields decay and contraction estimates.
Theorem 6.12 (Contraction of semigroup). If (D) is (m)-dissipative on a Banach space (X), then the semigroup ({U_t}) generated by (D) satisfies:[|U_tx-U_ty|\le |x-y|\quad\forall x,y\in X,\ t\ge 0.]If (D) is (\alpha)-strongly dissipative (in the sense of accretivity of (-D)), then:[|U_tx-U_ty|\le e^{-\alpha t}|x-y|.]
Definition 6.13 (Decay functional). A decay law is a bound:[|U_t x - x^\star|\le \rho(t)|x-x^\star|]for an equilibrium (x^\star) with (\rho(t)\downarrow 0). Decay objects include the rate function (\rho), its derivation, and admissibility conditions (coercivity, Poincaré inequality, spectral gap).
Proposition 6.14 (Spectral gap decay, linear self-adjoint case). For (D=\Delta) self-adjoint negative semidefinite on (L^2), if the first nonzero eigenvalue satisfies (\lambda_1>0) (on mean-zero subspace), then:[|U_t x|{L^2}\le e^{-\lambda_1 t}|x|{L^2}.]
Semigroup decay is a certificate source: contractivity and decay can be proven analytically or verified by replay on a pinned test net.
6.1.2.2 Maximum principles and monotone quantities
Maximum principles provide discrete and continuous monotonicity invariants, crucial for constraint correctness and stability.
Definition 6.15 (Maximum principle, continuous). An operator (D) satisfies a maximum principle on a function space if solutions of (\partial_t u = D u) obey:[\sup_M u(t,\cdot) \le \sup_M u(0,\cdot),\qquad \inf_M u(t,\cdot) \ge \inf_M u(0,\cdot)]under admissible boundary conditions.
Definition 6.16 (Discrete maximum principle). A discrete operator (D) on a graph satisfies the discrete maximum principle if, for forward Euler step (u^{n+1}=u^n+\Delta t,D u^n), one has invariance of bounds under a pinned step size constraint (CFL condition).
Definition 6.17 (Monotone quantities). A functional (M:X\to\mathbb R) is monotone along the (D)-flow if (M(x(t))) is nonincreasing/nondecreasing. Typical monotones:
total variation in diffusion-like settings,
entropy functionals in dissipative Markov settings (when (\Sigma) present),
constraint violation functionals under projected flows.
Monotonicity is integrated into corridor truth: if a scheme violates a required maximum principle under a corridor, it is FAIL for claims requiring that invariant.
6.1.2.3 Operator domains and closures
Correctness depends on explicit domain management.
Definition 6.18 (Closable operator). An operator (D) is closable if whenever (x_n\to 0) and (Dx_n\to y), then (y=0). The closure (\overline{D}) is the minimal closed extension.
Definition 6.19 (Closed operator). (D) is closed if its graph is closed: (x_n\to x) and (Dx_n\to y) implies (x\in\mathrm{Dom}(D)) and (Dx=y).
Rule 6.20 (Domain propagation in compositions). For composite operators and for transport via conjugacy (Chapter 3), admissible domain is the intersection domain defined by typed composition:[\mathrm{Dom}(g\circ f) = {x\in \mathrm{Dom}(f)\mid f(x)\in \mathrm{Dom}(g)},]and closures must be used when passing to limits (discretization refinement, weak solutions).
Definition 6.21 (Boundary-induced domains). Boundary conditions restrict domains:
Dirichlet typically yields domain (H_0^1\cap H^2),
Neumann yields (H^2) with normal derivative constraints,
discrete analogs impose constraints on adjacency and weights.
Domains are part of the presentation and must be carried through all rotation and corridor processes.
6.1.2.4 Defect measures for discretization
Discretization introduces defects relative to continuous operators and invariants.
Definition 6.22 (Discretization defect). Let (D) be a continuous operator on (X), and (D_h) a discrete operator on (X_h) with embedding (P_h:X_h\to X) and restriction (R_h:X\to X_h). The discretization defect on region (S_h\subseteq X_h) is:[\Delta_{\mathrm{disc}}(h;S_h) := \sup_{x_h\in S_h} \left| D(P_h x_h) - P_h(D_h x_h)\right|_X,]where norms are pinned. A variant measures residual mismatch at the presentation level.
Definition 6.23 (Consistency and stability). A scheme is consistent if (\Delta_{\mathrm{disc}}(h;S_h)\to 0) as (h\to 0). It is stable if the discrete semigroup (U^h_t) is uniformly bounded/contractive in a pinned norm.
Rule 6.24 (Convergence via Lax-type principles). Under appropriate conditions, consistency + stability yields convergence. The corridor must pin which convergence theorem is invoked and which assumptions are required (regularity, coercivity).
Defect measures feed the residual ledger (Chapter 4) and control NEAR→OK upgrades under refinement.
6.1.3 Algorithms
6.1.3.1 Build Laplacian/gradient-flow templates
Templates construct (D) operators on discrete and continuous carriers from declared structures.
Algorithm 6.25 (BuildGraphLaplacian). Input: weighted graph ((V,E,w)), vertex masses (m_i), boundary object (\mathcal B). Output: discrete Laplacian (L) and domain guards.
Construction (normalized form):[(Lx)i := \frac{1}{m_i}\sum{j:(i,j)\in E} w_{ij}(x_j-x_i),]with boundary enforcement:
Dirichlet nodes fixed,
Neumann via edge weight modifications,
periodic via identified nodes.
Algorithm 6.26 (BuildGradientFlow). Input: energy functional (E(x)) in typed AST, carrier (X), constraint object (\mathcal C). Output: (D(x)=-\nabla E(x)) or (D(x)\in -\partial E(x)), with enforcement mode.
Steps:
Parse and type-check (E) and constraints (Chapter 2).
Select derivative mechanism: symbolic gradient, automatic differentiation, or variational derivative (pinned).
Build (D) as explicit formula or oracle with replay transcript.
If constraints present, compile projected/penalty/barrier dynamics with explicit domain guards.
Pseudocode:
function BuildGradientFlow(E_ast, Carrier, Constraint, Policy):
ensure_typed(E_ast, Carrier)
grad = build_gradient(E_ast, method=Policy.grad_method)
if Constraint.mode == "project":
D = (x) => project_to_tangent(-grad(x), Constraint, x)
elif Constraint.mode == "barrier":
D = (x) => -grad(x) - grad(barrier(Constraint))(x)
else:
D = (x) => -grad(x) - penalty_term(Constraint)(x)
Dom = domain_guards(E_ast, Constraint)
return (D, Dom)
6.1.3.2 Time stepping and stability checks
Time stepping is compiled with explicit stability diagnostics.
Algorithm 6.27 (TimeStepExplicitEuler). For (\dot x = D(x)):[x^{n+1} = x^n + \Delta t,D(x^n).]Stability requires corridor-pinned step constraints (e.g., CFL for diffusion, Lipschitz constraints for gradients).
Algorithm 6.28 (TimeStepImplicitEuler).[x^{n+1} = x^n + \Delta t,D(x^{n+1}),]requiring a solver for the implicit equation; for monotone (D), implicit Euler is often contractive and energy stable.
Algorithm 6.29 (StabilityCheck). Input: operator data (spectral estimates or Lipschitz bounds), step size (\Delta t), corridor thresholds. Output: PASS/FAIL/AMBIG plus obligations.
For linear (D) with known spectral radius (\rho(D_h)), explicit Euler stability constraint:[\Delta t \le \frac{2}{\rho(-D_h)}]in relevant norms (exact formula pinned per scheme). For nonlinear (D), use Lipschitz bound (L) with:[\Delta t \le \frac{c}{L}]where (c) is method-dependent.
Stability checks must emit:
bound derivation method,
constants used and their provenance (analytic or estimated with certificates),
ledger entries for approximate bounds.
6.1.3.3 Constraint enforcement routines
Constraint enforcement must preserve validity and avoid drift.
Algorithm 6.30 (ProjectToFeasibleSet). Input: state (x), constraint object (\mathcal C) with feasible set (K), projection operator (P_K) if available. Output: (x'\in K) or AMBIG/FAIL.
If (P_K) is explicit and certified: (x':=P_K(x)).
If (K) is defined by equalities and has tangent projection: compute tangent correction.
If projection requires solving: emit solver template with replay obligations.
Algorithm 6.31 (BarrierEnforce). Input: (x), inequality constraints (G(x)\le 0), barrier parameter (\mu). Output: modified (D_\mu(x)=D(x)-\mu\nabla \sum_i \log(-G_i(x))) on admissible domain (G(x)<0).
Barrier enforcement must:
declare domain guard (G(x)<0),
manage (\mu) schedule explicitly (policy),
include stability constraints due to stiffness.
6.1.3.4 Sparse solvers and preconditioners
(D)-systems produce sparse linear/nonlinear solves.
Algorithm 6.32 (SparseLinearSolve). Input: sparse SPD system (Ax=b), corridor policy. Output: solution (x) with residual and certificate artifacts.
Methods (pinned selection):
Conjugate Gradient (CG) with preconditioner (M),
MINRES for symmetric indefinite,
GMRES for general,
multigrid preconditioning when available.
Each solver emits:
iteration transcript,
stopping criteria in residual norms,
determinism policy (fixed ordering, pinned tolerances),
a posteriori residual certificate.
Algorithm 6.33 (PreconditionerBuild). Input: operator (A), graph/mesh structure, corridor constraints. Output: preconditioner (M).
Examples:
Jacobi/diagonal scaling,
incomplete Cholesky,
algebraic multigrid (AMG) hierarchy,
domain decomposition.
Preconditioner construction is part of the algorithmic artifact set and must be replayable for certification.
6.1.4 Certificates
6.1.4.1 Contractivity certs
A contractivity certificate proves that the discrete or continuous evolution is contractive in a pinned metric.
Forms:
Semigroup contractivity: (|U_t|\le 1) for all (t\ge 0).
Strong contraction: (|U_t|\le e^{-\alpha t}) for (\alpha>0).
Discrete step contractivity: (|x^{n+1}-y^{n+1}|\le q|x^n-y^n|) with (q\le 1) under step constraints.
Certificate contents:
operator definition and domain,
metric/norm,
proof method (analytic or verified numeric bounds),
region of validity,
replay transcript where applicable.
6.1.4.2 Energy decay certs
Energy decay certifies Lyapunov monotonicity and dissipation identities.
Requirements:
explicit (E) and (\mathcal D),
proof that (\frac{d}{dt}E=-\mathcal D\le 0) (continuous) or (E(x^{n+1})\le E(x^n)) (discrete),
boundary/constraint compatibility.
Discrete energy decay often requires implicit schemes or special integrators; the certificate must specify the exact scheme and step constraints.
6.1.4.3 Stability region / CFL certs
Stability region certificates assert that the chosen time-step scheme is stable under pinned constraints (CFL).
Contents:
scheme definition,
spectral/Lipschitz bounds used,
computed admissible (\Delta t) range,
failure conditions and guard checks,
any approximation terms recorded in ledger.
6.1.4.4 A priori convergence certs
A priori convergence certs provide theoretical rates under regularity assumptions.
Examples:
finite difference/element convergence rates,
gradient descent convergence under smoothness/convexity,
monotone operator convergence for implicit schemes.
Certificate includes:
assumptions and admissible region,
theorem reference (internal proof or pinned external),
rate statement and constants,
compatibility with corridor tightening schedules (Chapter 4 and Chapter 6.4).
6.2 Flower ((\Omega)) — Oscillatory/coherent pole
6.2.1 Objects
6.2.1.1 Inner products, symplectic forms, phase spaces
The (\Omega)-pole encodes reversible dynamics, coherence, and phase-structured invariants.
Definition 6.34 (Hilbert phase space). A Hilbert phase space is ((X,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)) with norm (|x|=\sqrt{\langle x,x\rangle}). Coherence is measured by norm preservation and phase invariants.
Definition 6.35 (Symplectic phase space). A symplectic manifold ((M,\omega)) has a nondegenerate closed 2-form (\omega). In canonical coordinates ((q,p)), (\omega=\sum_i dq_i\wedge dp_i). Symplectic maps preserve (\omega).
Definition 6.36 (Poisson structure). A Poisson bracket ({\cdot,\cdot}) defines Hamiltonian vector fields (X_H) by (\dot f={f,H}). This supports generalized (\Omega)-dynamics beyond canonical symplectic form.
Definition 6.37 (Coherent observable suite). Coherent suites include:
norm (|x|),
symplectic form (\omega),
action variables and phase integrals,
spectra and mode energies,
conserved charges derived from symmetries.
These suites are pinned in the presentation metadata and are required to be preserved (OK) or bounded (NEAR) under (\Omega)-claims.
6.2.1.2 Skew-adjoint/Hamiltonian generators
(\Omega) is the generator of unitary or symplectic flows.
Definition 6.38 (Skew-adjoint generator). On a Hilbert space (X), an operator (\Omega:\mathrm{Dom}(\Omega)\to X) is skew-adjoint if (\Omega^\ast=-\Omega). Then (\Omega) generates a strongly continuous unitary group ({U_t}_{t\in\mathbb R}) with:[U_t = e^{t\Omega},\qquad |U_t x|=|x|.]
Definition 6.39 (Hamiltonian generator). For a self-adjoint Hamiltonian (H), define:[\Omega := -iH,]so (U_t=e^{-itH}) is unitary. In classical symplectic settings, the Hamiltonian vector field (X_H) is (\Omega).
Definition 6.40 (Coherent evolution). A coherent evolution is characterized by:
invertibility for all times (t),
conservation of a norm/volume form,
preservation of a symplectic structure or probability current,subject to explicit domain conditions and boundary compatibility.
6.2.1.3 Conserved charges and Noether data
Conserved quantities are first-class invariants.
Definition 6.41 (Noether datum). A Noether datum is a tuple:[\mathcal N := (G,\ \mathrm{Action},\ H,\ J,\ \mathrm{Hypotheses})]where:
(G) is a symmetry group,
Action specifies (G) acting on phase space,
(H) is Hamiltonian (or Lagrangian),
(J) is a momentum map or conserved charge,
Hypotheses include differentiability and invariance conditions.
Proposition 6.42 (Charge conservation). If (H) is invariant under the action generated by (J), then (J) is conserved along the flow:[\frac{d}{dt}J(x(t))=0.]In the operator form, charges commute with the Hamiltonian: ([H,Q]=0) implies conservation of (Q)-expectation in quantum settings.
Charges are registered as invariants with explicit verification methods and admissibility domains.
6.2.1.4 Mode/eigenbasis objects
Coherent dynamics often diagonalize in spectral bases.
Definition 6.43 (Eigenbasis object). For a normal operator (H) with spectral decomposition (discrete or continuous), an eigenbasis object includes:
spectral measure or eigenpairs ((\lambda_k,\phi_k)),
truncation policy for finite representations,
normalization and phase convention rules,
projection operators (P_\Lambda) onto spectral bands.
Definition 6.44 (Mode energy). The modal energy of (x) in eigenbasis ({\phi_k}) is (E_k=|\langle x,\phi_k\rangle|^2). In unitary evolution with (H) diagonal, (E_k) is preserved (exactly), while phases evolve as (e^{-it\lambda_k}).
Eigenbasis objects must carry:
spectral truncation bounds,
aliasing risk when discretized,
certificates for orthonormality or symplecticity as appropriate.
6.2.2 Calculus
6.2.2.1 Unitary/symplectic flows
The (\Omega) calculus is conservation-based.
Theorem 6.45 (Unitary flow invariants). If (\Omega^\ast=-\Omega) on a Hilbert space, then (U_t=e^{t\Omega}) satisfies:[U_t^\ast U_t = I,\qquad |U_t x|=|x|,]and inner products are preserved:[\langle U_t x, U_t y\rangle = \langle x,y\rangle.]
Theorem 6.46 (Symplectic flow). If (x(t)) solves Hamilton’s equations with Hamiltonian (H), then the flow map (\Phi_t) is symplectic:[\Phi_t^\ast \omega = \omega,]and preserves phase-space volume (Liouville).
Conservation-based calculus interacts with corridors: any method claiming (\Omega)-coherence must provide norm/symplecticity certificates or accept NEAR with bounded leakage.
6.2.2.2 Dispersion relations and resonance constraints
Coherent dynamics in wave systems are governed by dispersion and resonance.
Definition 6.47 (Dispersion relation). For a linear PDE or lattice system diagonalized by Fourier modes (k), the dispersion relation is (\omega(k)) such that mode phases evolve as (e^{-it\omega(k)}).
Definition 6.48 (Resonance constraint). A resonance among modes (k_1,\ldots,k_m) is a relation:[\pm \omega(k_1)\pm\cdots\pm \omega(k_m)=0]with corresponding momentum constraints (e.g., (k_1+\cdots+k_m=0)). Resonances determine energy transfer and constrain admissible truncations.
Resonance constraints are encoded as:
algebraic relations,
spectral band objects,
bounds on mode coupling strength under truncation.
6.2.2.3 Basis changes as conjugacies
Basis changes are conjugacy transports (Chapter 3) specialized to coherent structures.
Rule 6.49 (Basis conjugacy). A basis change (S) transports operators by:[H' = S^{-1}HS,\qquad \Omega' = S^{-1}\Omega S,]and preserves coherence only if (S) is structure-preserving:
unitary in Hilbert spaces ((S^\ast S=I)),
symplectic in phase spaces ((S^\top J S = J) for canonical (J)),
lattice-preserving when discrete invariants are pinned.
Definition 6.50 (Coherence defect under basis change). If (S) is approximate, define:[\Delta_{\mathrm{unit}} := |S^\ast S - I|,\qquad \Delta_{\mathrm{symp}} := |S^\top J S - J|,]in pinned norms. These defects populate the residual ledger and determine NEAR vs FAIL under the corridor.
6.2.2.4 Coherence defects (non-unitary leakage)
Coherence defect is leakage of conserved structure.
Definition 6.51 (Leakage). For a purported coherent propagator (\widetilde U_t), define leakage on region (S) by:[\Delta_{\mathrm{leak}}(t;S) := \sup_{x\in S}\big||\widetilde U_t x|^2 - |x|^2\big|.]For symplecticity:[\Delta_{\omega}(t;S):=\sup_{x\in S}|\widetilde \Phi_t^\ast \omega - \omega|.]
Leakage may arise from:
non-symplectic integrators,
spectral truncation and aliasing,
numerical damping,
inconsistent phase conventions.
Corridor policies define whether leakage is acceptable (NEAR) and how it must be bounded, or whether any leakage is FAIL (strict coherence corridors).
6.2.3 Algorithms
6.2.3.1 Fourier/eigen transforms and diagonal propagation
Diagonal propagation is the canonical (\Omega)-algorithm.
Algorithm 6.52 (DiagonalPropagate). Input: operator (H) with spectral decomposition, initial state (x_0), time (t). Output: (x(t)).
Steps:
Compute spectral coefficients (c_k=\langle x_0,\phi_k\rangle).
Evolve phases: (c_k(t)=e^{-it\lambda_k}c_k).
Reconstruct: (x(t)=\sum_k c_k(t)\phi_k) (with truncation policy if finite).
For continuous spectra, use spectral integrals with pinned quadrature or FFT-based approximations.
Outputs:
propagated state,
spectral truncation ledger entries,
aliasing diagnostics if discretized.
6.2.3.2 Symplectic integrators
When diagonalization is unavailable or nonlinear, symplectic integrators preserve structure.
Algorithm 6.53 (SymplecticEuler). For separable Hamiltonian (H(q,p)=T(p)+V(q)):[p^{n+1}=p^n-\Delta t,\nabla V(q^n),\qquad q^{n+1}=q^n+\Delta t,\nabla T(p^{n+1}).]
Algorithm 6.54 (Störmer–Verlet).[p^{n+\frac12}=p^n-\frac{\Delta t}{2}\nabla V(q^n),\quadq^{n+1}=q^n+\Delta t,\nabla T(p^{n+\frac12}),\quadp^{n+1}=p^{n+\frac12}-\frac{\Delta t}{2}\nabla V(q^{n+1}).]
Integrator selection is pinned by corridor and includes step-size constraints, stability diagnostics, and drift monitoring.
6.2.3.3 Phase convention management
Phase conventions must be pinned to avoid hidden gauge drift.
Algorithm 6.55 (NormalizeEigenPhases). Input: eigenvectors (\phi_k), phase policy. Output: phase-normalized eigenvectors.
Policies:
enforce (\langle \phi_k, v_{\mathrm{ref}}\rangle \in \mathbb R_+) for pinned reference (v_{\mathrm{ref}}),
enforce a component positivity on a pinned index,
enforce continuity along parameter sweeps by phase tracking (with explicit tie-break).
Phase normalization emits:
phase factors applied,
gauge-fixing certificate obligations,
holonomy diagnostics if phases are tracked around loops.
6.2.3.4 Resonance detection and control
Resonance drives instability and energy transfer; detection and control are required for truncation and approximation.
Algorithm 6.56 (DetectResonances). Input: dispersion relation (\omega(k)), mode set (K), resonance tolerance (\tau), interaction order (m). Output: resonance set.
Steps:
Enumerate candidate tuples ((k_1,\ldots,k_m)) under pinned combinatorial budget.
Check momentum constraints (if applicable).
Compute resonance mismatch:[r=\left|\pm\omega(k_1)\pm\cdots\pm\omega(k_m)\right|.]
Record tuples with (r\le \tau).
Emit evidence plan or abstain if enumeration budget insufficient.
Algorithm 6.57 (ResonanceControl). Methods include:
adjust truncation bands to avoid near-resonances,
add de-aliasing filters (recorded as (D)-leakage if dissipative),
choose symplectic schemes minimizing resonance artifacts.
Control measures are pinned and recorded in ledgers; any dissipative stabilization must be declared as introduction of (D)-component.
6.2.4 Certificates
6.2.4.1 Norm conservation certs
Certify norm preservation (unitarity) on a declared region or test suite:[\sup_{x\in S}\big||U x|^2-|x|^2\big|\le \varepsilon.]Strict corridors may require (\varepsilon=0) (exact arithmetic or formal proof); otherwise NEAR with ledgered bounds.
6.2.4.2 Symplecticity certs
Certify symplectic structure preservation:
exact symplecticity for integrators with known symplectic maps,
or bounded symplectic defect (\Delta_{\mathrm{symp}}\le \varepsilon).
Certificates include:
definition of (\omega) (or canonical (J)),
method (analytic or verified numeric),
region and step bounds.
6.2.4.3 Spectral truncation/alias certs
Certify that truncation error and aliasing are bounded under pinned norms and assumptions.
Contents:
truncation policy and band definitions,
energy in excluded modes bounded (a priori) or measured (a posteriori),
de-aliasing filters and their effects,
resonance diagnostics if required.
6.2.4.4 Coherence audits
Coherence audits certify absence of hidden drift:
phase convention coherence across modules,
basis change unitarity/symplecticity,
holonomy boundedness for phase tracking loops,
consistency of conjugacy transports used in the (\Omega)-pipeline.
Audits can trigger quarantine if repeated leakage or phase holonomy exceeds corridor thresholds.
6.3 Cloud ((\Sigma)) — Stochastic/ensemble pole
6.3.1 Objects
6.3.1.1 Markov generators and kernels
The (\Sigma)-pole encodes stochastic evolution, ensemble mixing, and probabilistic semantics.
Definition 6.58 (Markov kernel). A Markov kernel (K:X\times\mathcal F\to[0,1]) satisfies:
(K(x,\cdot)) is a probability measure,
(K(\cdot,A)) is measurable for each (A\in\mathcal F).
It induces a linear operator on measures:[\mu K(A)=\int_X K(x,A),d\mu(x),]and a dual operator on observables (f):[(Kf)(x)=\int f(y),K(x,dy).]
Definition 6.59 (Markov semigroup and generator). A family ({P_t}_{t\ge 0}) is a Markov semigroup if:
(P_0=I),
(P_{t+s}=P_tP_s),
(P_t) preserves positivity and constants,
(P_t) is contractive in suitable norms (corridor-dependent).
The generator (L) is:[Lf=\lim_{t\downarrow 0}\frac{P_tf-f}{t},]on its domain.
Definition 6.60 (Diffusion generator). On (X=\mathbb R^d), a diffusion generator has form:[Lf(x)=b(x)\cdot\nabla f(x)+\frac12 \mathrm{tr}\big(a(x)\nabla^2 f(x)\big),]with (a=\sigma\sigma^\top\succeq 0).
(\Sigma)-objects include:
kernels (K),
generators (L),
associated Fokker–Planck operators on densities,
sampling procedures and randomness policies (Chapter 5).
6.3.1.2 Stationary measures and invariant distributions
Invariant distributions define equilibrium semantics.
Definition 6.61 (Stationary measure). A measure (\pi) is stationary for (P_t) if:[\pi P_t = \pi\quad\forall t\ge 0.]Equivalently, (\int Lf,d\pi=0) for suitable (f).
Definition 6.62 (Invariant distribution object). An invariant distribution object stores:
candidate (\pi) (density or measure class),
admissibility conditions (integrability, support),
method of construction (analytic, numerical fixed point, sampling),
certificates for invariance and uniqueness/mixing when required.
In equilibrium thermodynamic settings, (\pi\propto e^{-V}) is pinned by potential (V), and (L) is designed to admit (\pi) (e.g., Langevin).
6.3.1.3 Entropy production objects
Entropy production quantifies irreversibility and convergence.
Definition 6.63 (Relative entropy). For measures (\mu\ll \pi),[\mathrm{KL}(\mu|\pi)=\int \log\left(\frac{d\mu}{d\pi}\right),d\mu.]
Definition 6.64 (Entropy production). A Markov semigroup has entropy production functional (\mathcal E(\mu)\ge 0) if:[\frac{d}{dt}\mathrm{KL}(\mu_t|\pi) = -\mathcal E(\mu_t),]where (\mu_t=\mu_0P_t) and (\pi) is stationary.
Entropy production objects include:
explicit (\mathcal E) where known (Dirichlet form),
conditions for validity (reversibility, log-Sobolev),
bounds linking (\mathcal E) to mixing rates.
6.3.1.4 Noise models (diffusion/jump/Langevin)
Noise models define admissibility and simulation methods.
Definition 6.65 (SDE model). An SDE is:[dX_t = b(X_t),dt + \sigma(X_t),dW_t,]with domain and regularity conditions ensuring existence/uniqueness. Its generator is diffusion form.
Definition 6.66 (Jump process / CTMC). A continuous-time Markov chain on countable state space has generator:[(Lf)(i)=\sum_{j\neq i} q_{ij}(f(j)-f(i)),]with rates (q_{ij}\ge 0), and (q_{ii}=-\sum_{j\neq i}q_{ij}).
Definition 6.67 (Langevin family). Langevin dynamics couples (D) and (\Sigma):[dX_t = -\nabla V(X_t),dt + \sqrt{2\beta^{-1}},dW_t,]with stationary (\pi\propto e^{-\beta V}). This is a canonical bridge between energy landscapes and stochastic exploration.
Noise model objects include:
coefficient functions,
domain guards (non-explosion, Lipschitz/linear growth),
discretization policies and their bias/variance ledgers.
6.3.2 Calculus
6.3.2.1 Mixing/ergodicity invariants
Mixing is an invariant class defining convergence to equilibrium.
Definition 6.68 (Total variation mixing). Define:[|\mu-\nu|{\mathrm{TV}} := \sup{A}|\mu(A)-\nu(A)|.]A semigroup mixes in TV if (|\mu P_t - \pi|_{\mathrm{TV}}\to 0) as (t\to\infty) for all admissible (\mu).
Definition 6.69 (Spectral gap). For reversible (P_t) on (L^2(\pi)), the spectral gap (\lambda>0) satisfies:[|P_tf-\pi(f)|{L^2(\pi)} \le e^{-\lambda t}|f-\pi(f)|{L^2(\pi)}.]
Definition 6.70 (Ergodicity). A process is ergodic if time averages converge to ensemble averages (\pi)-almost surely, under pinned conditions.
Mixing invariants are tied to corridor truth: claims depending on sampling correctness require mixing certificates or must remain NEAR/AMBIG.
6.3.2.2 Detailed balance and reversibility conditions
Reversibility provides powerful structure and entropy decay.
Definition 6.71 (Detailed balance). A kernel (K) satisfies detailed balance w.r.t. (\pi) if:[\pi(dx)K(x,dy) = \pi(dy)K(y,dx).]For generators, detailed balance corresponds to symmetry in (L^2(\pi)).
Proposition 6.72 (Entropy decay under log-Sobolev). If (\pi) satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality with constant (\rho>0), then:[\mathrm{KL}(\mu_t|\pi)\le e^{-2\rho t}\mathrm{KL}(\mu_0|\pi),]and mixing in stronger metrics follows.
Corridors specify whether reversibility is required or whether non-reversible dynamics is allowed with alternative certificates.
6.3.2.3 Information geometry of flows
Stochastic flows can be analyzed geometrically via divergences and Fisher information.
Definition 6.73 (Fisher information). For density (p) w.r.t. (\pi),[\mathcal I(p|\pi) := \int \left|\nabla \log\left(\frac{p}{\pi}\right)\right|^2 p,dx]when defined. For many diffusions, entropy production equals Fisher information (Dirichlet form).
Definition 6.74 (Gradient flow in probability space). Certain dissipative PDEs (e.g., Fokker–Planck) are gradient flows of KL in Wasserstein geometry. This provides a bridge: (\Sigma) can manifest as (D) in an appropriate metric space.
Information-geometric objects provide:
curvature-like quantities (convexity of KL),
contraction coefficients in Wasserstein,
stability diagnostics for inference and learning.
6.3.2.4 Stochastic stability defects
Discretization and approximation introduce stochastic stability defects.
Definition 6.75 (Invariant measure defect). For discretized kernel (K_h) intended to preserve (\pi), define:[\Delta_{\pi}(h) := d_{\mathrm{dist}}(\pi K_h,\pi),]in a pinned distribution metric. For sampling, define estimator bias and variance defects.
Definition 6.76 (Weak error and strong error). For SDE integrators:
weak error: (|\mathbb E[f(X_t)] - \mathbb E[f(\widetilde X_t)]|),
strong error: (\mathbb E[|X_t-\widetilde X_t|]),each with pinned test function classes and assumptions.
Stochastic defects populate the residual ledger and drive NEAR discipline and upgrade rules (Chapter 4).
6.3.3 Algorithms
6.3.3.1 SDE/CTMC simulation templates
Simulation is treated as a replayable algorithm with pinned randomness.
Algorithm 6.77 (Euler–Maruyama). For SDE (dX_t=b(X_t)dt+\sigma(X_t)dW_t),[X_{n+1} = X_n + b(X_n)\Delta t + \sigma(X_n)\Delta W_n,\quad \Delta W_n\sim \mathcal N(0,\Delta t,I),]with pinned PRNG and stream schedule.
Algorithm 6.78 (Gillespie / SSA for CTMC).
At state (i), total rate (\lambda=\sum_{j\neq i}q_{ij}).
Sample waiting time (\Delta t \sim \mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)).
Choose next state (j) with probability (q_{ij}/\lambda).
Both algorithms must output:
transcript commitments,
random stream commitments,
bias/variance ledger entries,
domain checks (non-explosion, boundedness) per corridor.
6.3.3.2 Estimation of mixing rates
Mixing rate estimation is a certificate-generating algorithm.
Algorithm 6.79 (EstimateMixing). Inputs: sample path (X_0,\ldots,X_N), observable suite ({f_k}), corridor policy. Outputs: mixing diagnostics and bound candidates.
Methods (pinned):
autocorrelation time estimates,
spectral gap estimates from reversible chain (eigenvalues of transition operator on sampled basis),
coupling diagnostics,
drift/minorization diagnostics when state structure allows.
If mixing cannot be certified within budget, outputs must be AMBIG evidence plan:
increase sample size,
change kernel,
use diagnostics compatible with tail regime.
6.3.3.3 Rare-event sampling and tilt transforms
Rare events require tilted measures and importance sampling.
Algorithm 6.80 (ImportanceSamplingTilt). For target event (A) with small probability under (\mu), define tilted measure (\mu_\theta) or kernel (K_\theta) to increase event frequency. Weight samples by likelihood ratio:[w(x)=\frac{d\mu}{d\mu_\theta}(x),]and estimate (\mu(A)=\mathbb E_{\mu_\theta}[w\mathbf 1_A]).
Tilt construction must be pinned and must include:
admissibility conditions ensuring absolute continuity,
variance control diagnostics,
ledger of estimator variance and bias.
Algorithm 6.81 (Splitting / genealogical methods). Define levels and resampling steps; pin resampling randomness policy; produce variance diagnostics and reproducibility artifacts.
6.3.3.4 Uncertainty ledger integration
Every stochastic computation integrates into the corridor ledger.
Algorithm 6.82 (IntegrateSigmaLedger). Input: simulation transcript, estimator outputs, corridor. Output: residual ledger entries and obligation tickets.
Required ledger entries:
sampling error bounds (confidence or tail bounds),
discretization bias bounds (weak error),
mixing diagnostics or mixing obligations,
identifiability/aliasing flags (if inference uses observed outputs),
determinism verification (PRNG pinned and replay matches).
6.3.4 Certificates
6.3.4.1 Positivity/mass preservation certs
Certify that kernels preserve probability structure:
positivity of transition probabilities,
normalization (row sums = 1 for discrete kernels),
mass preservation for measure evolution.
For numerical schemes, certify that any renormalization is explicit and ledgered, and that renormalization does not violate corridor invariants.
6.3.4.2 Mixing rate certs
Certify mixing/ergodicity properties to the extent required by corridor:
spectral gap lower bounds,
log-Sobolev constants,
drift/minorization conditions,
empirically certified mixing bounds (only if corridor permits and includes safety margins).
Certificates must specify:
region of validity,
tail regime assumptions,
method and replay transcript.
6.3.4.3 Entropy production bounds
Certify entropy decay or entropy production lower bounds.
Examples:
Dirichlet form bounds,
log-Sobolev-based exponential KL decay,
bounded entropy production under nonreversible dynamics.
Certificates include explicit stationary distribution object and admissibility conditions.
6.3.4.4 Simulation determinism policies
Certify replay determinism under pinned randomness:
PRNG algorithm and seed commitments,
stream usage schedule,
transcript hash stability,
deterministic floating environment pinning if required (rounding mode, parallelism).
If determinism cannot be guaranteed, corridor must downgrade and represent outputs as interval bounds or AMBIG.
6.4 Fractal ((\Psi)) — Recursive/multiscale pole
6.4.1 Objects
6.4.1.1 Restriction/prolongation operators
The (\Psi)-pole encodes recursion, scale change, coarse-graining, and multiresolution computation. Its primitive objects are scale maps.
Definition 6.83 (Restriction/prolongation pair). A pair ((R,P)) between fine space (X_h) and coarse space (X_H) is:[R:X_h\to X_H,\qquad P:X_H\to X_h,]with pinned consistency targets (see 6.4.2.1). (R) and (P) are typed transforms in the sense of Chapter 3, with explicit admissible domains and metric structure.
Definition 6.84 (Coarse projector). The operator (PR:X_h\to X_h) is a coarse projector onto the representable subspace. The defect of representability is:[\Delta_{\mathrm{proj}} := |PR-\Pi|]for a pinned projector (\Pi) (often identity on a subspace), or measured on a pinned test set.
Restriction/prolongation objects include:
construction method and parameters,
boundary compatibility constraints,
stability constants and interpolation errors.
6.4.1.2 Multigrid cycles and RG steps
(\Psi) comprises discrete recursion operators.
Definition 6.85 (Multigrid cycle operator). A multigrid cycle is an operator (M:X_h\to X_h) defined by:
pre-smoothing (S_\nu),
restriction (R),
coarse solve (exact or approximate) on (X_H),
prolongation (P),
post-smoothing,with pinned ordering and iteration counts. The multigrid operator induces a contraction in appropriate norms under conditions.
Definition 6.86 (Renormalization operator). An RG step is an operator[\mathcal R:\Theta\to\Theta]on parameter space (or on model/presentation space), together with induced transformations on states and observables. RG steps are typed and include:
coarse-graining map,
parameter update,
induced change in presentation normal form,
admissibility and stability conditions.
6.4.1.3 Wavelet/multiresolution bases
Wavelets provide a canonical (\Psi)-basis.
Definition 6.87 (Multiresolution analysis). A multiresolution analysis is a nested sequence of subspaces:[\cdots \subset V_{j-1}\subset V_j\subset V_{j+1}\subset\cdots]with (V_{j+1}=V_j\oplus W_j), where (W_j) captures details. Operators (R) and (P) become orthogonal projections and embeddings in wavelet bases.
Definition 6.88 (Wavelet transform object). A wavelet transform object includes:
analysis operator (W:X\to {c_j,d_j}),
synthesis operator (W^{-1}),
filter bank definitions (pinned),
boundary extension rules,
aliasing and truncation diagnostics.
Wavelet objects unify coarse-grain and detail extraction and provide natural defect measures for scale propagation.
6.4.1.4 Fixed-point and exponent objects
Fixed points organize recursion and universality.
Definition 6.89 (Fixed point and linearization). A fixed point (\theta^\star) of (\mathcal R) satisfies (\mathcal R(\theta^\star)=\theta^\star). Linearization:[L := D\mathcal R(\theta^\star)]yields eigenpairs ((\lambda_i,v_i)). Exponents and relevance classification are derived from (\lambda_i).
Definition 6.90 (Relevant/irrelevant/marginal).
relevant: (|\lambda_i|>1),
irrelevant: (|\lambda_i|<1),
marginal: (|\lambda_i|=1) (requires higher-order analysis).
Fixed-point objects include:
(\theta^\star),
eigen-spectrum of (L),
critical exponents and invariant suites,
admissibility neighborhood where linearization is valid.
6.4.2 Calculus
6.4.2.1 Coarse-grain consistency ((RP\approx I)) corridors
Coarse-grain consistency is the core (\Psi)-invariant.
Definition 6.91 (RP-consistency). The pair ((R,P)) is RP-consistent on (X_H) if:[|RP - I_{X_H}|\le \varepsilon_{RP}]in a pinned operator norm (or on a pinned test set). Similarly, PR-consistency on (X_h) is:[|PR - \Pi_h|\le \varepsilon_{PR},]for a pinned projector (\Pi_h).
Rule 6.92 (RP corridor). A (\Psi)-corridor requires:
explicit (R,P) objects with domains and boundary compatibility,
RP and PR consistency certificates within corridor tolerances,
stability constants for propagation of defects across scales,
a tightening schedule for tolerances under refinement (Chapter 4.4).
RP corridors govern whether multiscale claims can be promoted to OK, or must remain NEAR/AMBIG.
6.4.2.2 Universality and relevance/irrelevance
Universality is equivalence under coarse-graining on observables.
Definition 6.93 (Observable family). At scale (j), define an observable family (\mathcal O_j) (pinned). Two presentations are universal-equivalent on (\mathcal O_j) if their induced statistics on (\mathcal O_j) match within tolerance.
Rule 6.94 (Relevance filter). Under RG, only relevant directions must be tracked explicitly across scales; irrelevant directions may be compressed into residual budgets. Any equivalence claim must:
specify which directions are treated as irrelevant and how their effects are bounded,
include certificates for contraction in irrelevant subspace when used for OK promotion.
6.4.2.3 Contraction and stability
(\Psi) provides contractivity across scales and iterative solvers.
Definition 6.95 (Multigrid contraction). A multigrid cycle operator (M) is contractive in norm (|\cdot|) on region (S\subseteq X_h) if:[|M(x)-M(y)|\le \kappa|x-y|\quad\forall x,y\in S,\ \kappa<1.]
Definition 6.96 (RG contraction in irrelevant subspace). If (L=D\mathcal R(\theta^\star)), contraction in irrelevant subspace is:[|L v| \le \kappa |v| \quad \text{for } v\in \mathrm{span}{v_i:|\lambda_i|<1}.]
Contraction certificates are the mechanism by which recursion upgrades NEAR to OK in corridors allowing fixed-point anchoring (Chapter 4.4).
6.4.2.4 Defect propagation across scales
Defects propagate through restriction, coarse solve, prolongation, and smoothing.
Definition 6.97 (Scale propagation bound). Let (e_h) be fine-scale defect and (e_H) coarse defect, and suppose (P) has operator norm (|P|\le \gamma). Then:[|P e_H| \le \gamma |e_H|.]Similarly, restriction maps errors with (|R|\le \beta).
Rule 6.98 (Propagation algebra). A multiscale pipeline yields:[\Delta_{\mathrm{fine}} \le \Delta_{\mathrm{smoother}} + \gamma \Delta_{\mathrm{coarse}} + \Delta_{RP/PR} + \Delta_{\mathrm{trunc}},]where:
(\Delta_{RP/PR}) captures representability defects,
(\Delta_{\mathrm{trunc}}) captures truncation/wavelet thresholding,each term certified or ledgered.
Propagation algebra is pinned by corridor and must be complete; missing terms force AMBIG.
6.4.3 Algorithms
6.4.3.1 Build multigrid operators from discretizations
Algorithm 6.99 (BuildMultigridHierarchy). Input: fine operator (A_h) (from (D)-pole), discretization structure, coarsening policy. Output: hierarchy ({A_{h_\ell}}), restriction/prolongation ((R_\ell,P_\ell)), smoothers (S_\ell).

ledger = record_rg_defects(theta, theta_next, stats, Policy)
return (theta_next, ledger)
6.4.3.3 Fixed-point solvers
Fixed-point solvers are certified recursion engines.

Recompute RP/PR and contraction certificate obligations.
Update corridor tightening schedule; re-evaluate truth classification as evidence accumulates.
All decisions are logged for replay; any nondeterministic refinement is forbidden unless corridor explicitly permits pinned randomness.
6.4.4 Certificates
6.4.4.1 Contraction certs
Contraction certificates for (\Psi) cover:
multigrid cycle contraction factors,
RG contraction in irrelevant subspace,
convergence rates of fixed-point solvers.
Certificates specify:
metric or energy,
admissible region,
contraction factor bound (\kappa<1),
method (analytic/verified numeric/replay-based as permitted),
compatibility with tightening schedule.
6.4.4.2 Universality certs
Universality certificates assert that two models/presentations share a universality class across a scale ladder.
Required components:
scale ladder (\mathcal E),
observable families (\mathcal O_\epsilon),
defect bounds (\Delta_\epsilon\le\varepsilon_\epsilon),
twist/commutation checks between rotation and coarse-grain,
fixed-point and exponent object matching where applicable,
explicit scope of equivalence (what is universal and what is not).
6.4.4.3 RP≈I corridor certs
RP/PR certificates establish representability consistency:[|RP - I|\le \varepsilon_{RP},\qquad |PR-\Pi|\le \varepsilon_{PR},]with pinned norms and admissible domains.
Certificates include:
construction method for (R,P),
boundary compatibility,
test regimes or analytic bounds,
effect on defect propagation algebra (how RP/PR terms enter global bounds).
6.4.4.4 End-to-end recursion correctness certs
End-to-end recursion certificates validate complete multiscale pipelines.
They certify:
determinism and replayability of the full recursion transcript,
closure under corridor requirements (all obligations satisfied or permitted as NEAR),
bounded defect propagation across scales (complete ledger),
stability against false closure (holonomy/twist monitoring where relevant),
correctness of compression/expansion seeds for multiscale modules (Chapter 5.4).
These certificates are required for promoting multiscale results to OK under Fractal corridors.

7.1 Square — Structural invariants and constraint kernels
7.1.1 Objects
7.1.1.1 Invariant suite objects and typing
Invariants are the primary semantic gates used by corridors to (i) validate claims, (ii) restrict admissible transforms, and (iii) certify equivalence edges.
Definition 7.1 (Invariant). Let (X) be a carrier, (U) a family of admissible evolutions on (X) (e.g., semigroup, discrete step map, solver iteration), and let (I:X\to\mathcal Y) be a typed map into a value space (\mathcal Y) equipped with a comparison predicate or metric (d_{\mathcal Y}). (I) is an invariant for (U) on a declared region (S\subseteq X) if:[\forall x\in S,\ \forall t\in\mathcal T:\ I(U_t(x)) = I(x)](when equality in (\mathcal Y) is defined), or, more generally,[\forall x\in S,\ \forall t\in\mathcal T:\ d_{\mathcal Y}(I(U_t(x)), I(x)) \le \varepsilon_I]under a corridor-pinned tolerance (\varepsilon_I).
Definition 7.2 (Monotone quantity). (I) is a monotone for (U) on (S) if (\mathcal Y) is ordered and:[\forall x\in S,\ \forall t\ge 0:\ I(U_t(x)) \preceq I(x)](or nondecreasing, depending on the declaration). Approximate monotonicity is defined via a slack function (\delta(t)\ge 0):[I(U_t(x)) \preceq I(x) + \delta(t),]with (\delta) pinned and ledgered.
Definition 7.3 (Invariant suite). An invariant suite is a typed record:[\mathfrak I := (\mathrm{SuiteID},\ \mathrm{SuiteType},\ {(I_j,\ \mathcal Y_j,\ d_j,\ \varepsilon_j,\ \mathrm{Region}_j,\ \mathrm{Method}j)}{j=1}^m,\ \mathrm{Meta})]where:
SuiteType ∈ {STRUCTURAL, SYMMETRY, PROBABILISTIC, MULTISCALE},
each (I_j) is a named invariant functional with pinned evaluation method,
(\varepsilon_j) is corridor-dependent tolerance (0 in strict corridors),
Region(_j) is the admissible region and domain/branch declarations for evaluation,
Method(_j) is analytic, verified numeric, or replay-based as permitted.
Invariant suites are referenced by EQUIV/DUAL edges (Chapter 5), and their evaluation populates residual ledgers (Chapter 4).
7.1.1.2 Constraint kernels and nullspaces as invariants
For the Square lens, the dominant invariants are structural kernels induced by constraints.
Definition 7.4 (Constraint kernel). Let (\Phi:X\to \mathbb V) define a presentation (\mathcal P=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0,\mathrm{Dom},\mathrm{Meta)). The kernel set is:[\mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal P) := {x\in \mathrm{Dom}\mid \Phi(x)\in \mathbb V_0}.]When (\mathbb V_0={0}), this is a classical kernel/zero set.
Definition 7.5 (Linear kernel invariants). For a linear map (A:X\to Y) (finite-dimensional), define invariants:
nullity: (\nu(A):=\dim\ker(A)),
rank: (\mathrm{rk}(A):=\dim(\mathrm{Im}(A))),
index: (\mathrm{ind}(A):=\dim\ker(A)-\dim\mathrm{coker}(A)) when meaningful,
sparsity pattern invariants: support of (A) under fixed basis.
These invariants are stable under admissible basis changes that preserve the structure in question (e.g., rank under any invertible change; sparsity under restricted discrete groups).
Definition 7.6 (Constraint activity pattern). For inequality constraints (G(x)\le 0), define the active set:[\mathcal A(x):={i: G_i(x)=0},]and the activity pattern invariant for constrained flows and solvers:[I_{\mathrm{act}}(x):=\mathcal A(x)](on regions where the active set is stable). Changes in (\mathcal A) are treated as structural events and must be recorded by solver transcripts; claims that assume a fixed active set require explicit certification.
7.1.1.3 Discrete structural invariants on graphs and complexes
Square invariants include combinatorial and algebraic invariants of discrete carriers.
Definition 7.7 (Graph invariants). For a graph (G=(V,E,w)), admissible invariants include:
number of connected components (c(G)),
degree sequence ({d_i}) (weighted or unweighted),
cut-size invariants under pinned partitions,
Laplacian kernel dimension (\dim\ker(L)) (equals (c(G)) under standard definitions),
conservation of total mass for diffusion-like flows: (\sum_i m_i x_i) under appropriate (D)-operators.
Definition 7.8 (Complex invariants). For a chain complex (C_\bullet) with boundary maps (\partial_k), define:
cycle space (Z_k=\ker(\partial_k)),
boundary space (B_k=\mathrm{Im}(\partial_{k+1})),
kernel dimensions (\dim Z_k) and (\dim B_k),and treat these as structural invariants under operations that preserve the complex (e.g., combinatorial isomorphisms, subdivision under certified chain homotopy equivalence).
Square-level “topological kernels” are expressed as kernel dimensions and boundary relations; their higher invariants are developed in Flower (7.2).
7.1.1.4 Invariant payloads and gating interfaces
Invariants are used as gating interfaces for equivalence, routing, and compilation.
Definition 7.9 (Invariant signature). An invariant signature for an atom (A) under corridor (C) is:[\mathrm{Sig}_C(A):=(\mathrm{SuiteID},\ {(j,\ I_j(A),\ \varepsilon_j,\ \mathrm{Region}j)}{j=1}^m)]in canonical normal form, with each value committed by hash when stored.
Definition 7.10 (Gating predicate). Given two objects (A,B) and suite (\mathfrak I), the gating predicate is:[\mathrm{Gate}{\mathfrak I}(A,B)=\bigwedge{j=1}^m \Big(d_j(I_j(A),I_j(B))\le \varepsilon_j\Big),]with the understanding that evaluation requires admissibility on declared regions. If any invariant cannot be evaluated due to missing domain/branch certificates, the gate returns AMBIG with an EvidencePlan, never PASS by default.
Invariant signatures are referenced by:
EQUIV/DUAL edges (require gate satisfaction),
route search (filter candidate routes before expensive defect evaluation),
corridor promotion (NEAR→OK requires invariant stability across replays and refinements).
7.1.2 Calculus
7.1.2.1 Conservation and monotonicity laws for (D)-flows
Square invariants are controlled by dissipative calculus (Chapter 6.1).
Proposition 7.11 (Mass conservation under divergence-form diffusion). For a discrete diffusion operator (L) satisfying row-sum zero with respect to masses (m_i),[\sum_i m_i (Lx)i = 0,]the conserved quantity is total mass:[I{\mathrm{mass}}(x):=\sum_i m_i x_i,\qquad I_{\mathrm{mass}}(U_t x)=I_{\mathrm{mass}}(x).]Analogous continuous statements hold for (\partial_t u=\nabla\cdot(A\nabla u)) with appropriate boundary conditions (no-flux).
Proposition 7.12 (Energy decay for gradient flows). For (\dot x=-\nabla E(x)) with (E) differentiable and bounded below:[\frac{d}{dt}E(x(t)) = -|\nabla E(x(t))|^2 \le 0,]so (E) is a monotone invariant (Lyapunov functional). In constrained settings, monotonicity holds under admissible projected flows or barrier flows, subject to corridor-pinned conditions.
Rule 7.13 (Invariant obligations induced by solver use). Any claim that depends on a conservation or Lyapunov monotonicity property must include:
an explicit statement of the invariant functional,
admissibility conditions (domain, boundary),
either an analytic proof or a replayable test suite validating invariance on a pinned regime,otherwise the corridor verdict cannot be OK.
7.1.2.2 Structural invariance under admissible transforms
Structural invariants are transported across conjugacies only when the transform preserves the relevant structure.
Rule 7.14 (Kernel transport). Let (\mathcal P=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0,\mathrm{Dom})) and let (T:X\leftrightarrow Y) be admissible on (S\subseteq\mathrm{Dom}\cap\mathrm{Dom}T). Then:[T\rightarrow\big(\mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal P)\cap S\big)=\mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal P^{(T)})\cap T_\rightarrow(S).]Thus, satisfaction kernels are invariant under admissible transport (Chapter 3), and kernel membership can be used as a strict equivalence gate.
Rule 7.15 (Discrete structural invariants). For discrete carriers, invariants such as sparsity pattern, lattice membership, and combinatorial adjacency are preserved only under transforms lying in corridor-permitted discrete subgroups. Any equivalence claim that uses such invariants must declare the subgroup admissibility predicate and attach a lattice/structure preservation certificate.
7.1.2.3 Defect metrics for invariant mismatch
Invariant mismatch yields defect terms used by corridors.
Definition 7.16 (Invariant mismatch defect). For suite (\mathfrak I) and objects (A,B), define:[\Delta_{\mathfrak I}(A,B):=\max_{j=1}^m \frac{d_j(I_j(A),I_j(B))}{\varepsilon_j^\star},]where (\varepsilon_j^\star) is the corridor’s normalization scale (strict corridors use (\varepsilon_j^\star=1) with requirement of zero mismatch; approximate corridors use declared (\varepsilon_j)). A gate passes iff (\Delta_{\mathfrak I}\le 1) and all evaluations are admissible.
Rule 7.17 (Invariant-first filtering). In route search and equivalence verification:
invariant gates are evaluated first (cheap filters),
only candidates that pass proceed to expensive diagram/commutator defect evaluation,
failures produce FAIL if mismatch exceeds tolerance by certified bounds, otherwise AMBIG if mismatch cannot be bounded due to missing admissibility.
7.1.2.4 Kernel-index calculus and structural indices
Square invariants include index-like quantities derived from kernels and images.
Definition 7.18 (Kernel-index). For a linear operator (A), define:[\mathrm{ind}(A)=\dim\ker(A) - \dim\mathrm{coker}(A).]In finite dimensions (\dim\mathrm{coker}(A)=\dim Y-\mathrm{rk}(A)), so:[\mathrm{ind}(A)=\dim X-\dim Y + \mathrm{rk}(A)-\mathrm{rk}(A)=\dim X-\dim Y]when (A) is between fixed finite-dimensional spaces; meaningful index theory arises in infinite-dimensional and constrained settings, where closed range and Fredholm properties must be certified.
Definition 7.19 (Discrete Laplacian kernel invariant). For graph Laplacian (L), (\dim\ker(L)) is invariant under graph isomorphisms and under conjugacy by permutation matrices; it equals the number of connected components under standard Laplacian definitions. This provides a structural gate for equivalence of graph-based carriers.
Kernel-index calculus supplies:
invariants for classification,
certificates for structural correctness of discretizations,
gates for detecting illegal transports that change kernel dimensions.
7.1.3 Algorithms
7.1.3.1 BuildInvariantSuite for Square objects
Algorithm 7.20 (BuildSquareInvariantSuite). Input: presentation (\mathcal P), carrier structure, corridor (C). Output: square invariant suite (\mathfrak I_D).
Selection rules (pinned by corridor):
Include domain invariants: domain guard satisfiability, branch single-valuedness flags.
Include kernel invariants: satisfaction kernel membership tests for reference points, nullity/rank invariants for linear constraints.
Include discrete invariants when carrier is discrete: connectivity, lattice membership, activity patterns.
Include monotone invariants for dissipative flows: Lyapunov functionals, mass conservation, maximum principle bounds.
Output is a suite record with explicit evaluation methods (symbolic, exact arithmetic, verified numeric, or replay tests) and region declarations.
7.1.3.2 Compute kernels, ranks, and structural signatures
Algorithm 7.21 (ComputeKernelSignature). Input: operator (A) (matrix or linear map oracle), structure flags (exact/float), corridor policy. Output: ((\mathrm{rk}(A),\nu(A),\mathrm{BasisKer},\mathrm{BasisIm})) as permitted.
Modes:
Exact mode (preferred for strict corridors): use exact arithmetic (integer/rational) or certified elimination to compute rank and nullspace basis; output exact invariants.
Verified numeric mode: compute rank with singular value bounds and interval certificates; return NEAR with residual ledger unless strict corridor.
Oracle mode: for implicit operators, compute kernel tests on pinned subspaces; return AMBIG if full rank cannot be certified.
Signature includes:
rank and nullity,
kernel basis hash (or kernel projector hash),
condition diagnostics (if numeric),
domain restrictions required for validity.
7.1.3.3 Evaluate monotone and conservation invariants along trajectories
Algorithm 7.22 (TrackMonotones). Input: flow/iteration transcript (x_0,\ldots,x_n), invariant functional (I), corridor thresholds. Output: monotonicity verification artifact.
Steps:
Evaluate (I(x_k)) for all (k) on declared admissible domain (domain enforcement).
Check monotone inequality (I(x_{k+1})\preceq I(x_k)+\delta_k), with slack (\delta_k) pinned by corridor (often 0).
If any violation exceeds tolerance, emit FAIL for invariants required by the claim; otherwise emit certificate with maximal slack observed and replay transcript.
This algorithm is used to certify maximum principles and Lyapunov decay in discretized implementations.
7.1.3.4 Invariant-based prefiltering for equivalence search
Algorithm 7.23 (InvariantGateFilter). Input: candidate equivalence edge (A\to B), suite (\mathfrak I), corridor (C). Output: PASS/FAIL/AMBIG plus obligations.
Steps:
Load invariant signatures (\mathrm{Sig}_C(A),\mathrm{Sig}_C(B)) if present; otherwise compute them deterministically.
For each (I_j) in suite:
verify admissibility on declared region,
compute mismatch (d_j(I_j(A),I_j(B))) or its bound,
record ledger entry.
If all mismatches within tolerances and admissible, PASS.
If any mismatch certified above tolerance, FAIL with minimal witness.
If any mismatch cannot be bounded due to missing certs/branch uncertainty, AMBIG with evidence plan to compute the missing invariant bound.
Invariant gate filtering is the canonical first step before attempting diagram commutation checks (Chapter 3 and 5).
7.1.4 Certificates
7.1.4.1 Structural invariant correctness certs
Structural invariant correctness certifies that computed invariant values are correct under pinned evaluation methods.
Contents:
invariant definition (typed AST),
domain and branch declarations,
evaluation method (exact/verified numeric/replay),
proof that the computed value is an upper/lower/interval bound or exact,
replay transcript and commitments.
7.1.4.2 Kernel preservation certs under transforms

transform object (T) and admissible region (S),
proof that (T) is bijective on (S) with branch safety,
proof that (\mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal P)\cap S) maps to (\mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal P^{(T)})\cap T(S)),
kernel dimension invariants preserved (rank/nullity) when applicable.
Failure of kernel preservation forces FAIL for equivalence claims that depend on kernel structure.

obligations for any missing invariants (AMBIG) or minimal witness for mismatch (FAIL),
linkage to the EQUIV/DUAL edge record in the MyceliumGraph (Chapter 5).
7.2 Flower — Symmetry, conserved charges, and topological kernels
7.2.1 Objects
7.2.1.1 Symmetry invariants and class functions
Flower invariants arise from symmetry and coherent structure; they are invariant under conjugacy and group actions.
Definition 7.24 (Group-invariant observable). Let (G) act on carrier (X). An observable (I:X\to\mathcal Y) is (G)-invariant on region (S\subseteq X) if:[I(g\cdot x)=I(x)\quad \forall g\in G,\ x\in S.]
Definition 7.25 (Conjugacy-class invariant). Let (A) be an operator and (S) an invertible change of basis. A function (J) on operators is conjugacy-invariant if:[J(S^{-1}AS)=J(A)]on the admissible domain where both sides are defined. Spectral invariants and trace-like invariants are standard class functions when the underlying objects are well-typed.
Symmetry invariants are used to:
certify basis changes and dualities,
gate equivalence across representations,
detect false unitarity and gauge drift (Chapter 3 and 6.2).
7.2.1.2 Conserved charges and Noether kernel objects
Conserved charges encode invariants of (\Omega)-dynamics and symmetry.
Definition 7.26 (Conserved charge). For an evolution (U_t) on (X), a charge (Q:X\to\mathbb R^k) is conserved on (S) if:[Q(U_t(x)) = Q(x)\quad \forall x\in S,\ t\in\mathcal T.]
Definition 7.27 (Noether kernel). A Noether kernel is a record:[\mathcal N := (G,\ \mathrm{Action},\ \mathcal L\ \text{or}\ H,\ Q,\ \mathrm{Hypotheses},\ \mathrm{ProofMethod})]where (G) is symmetry group, (\mathcal L) or (H) is Lagrangian/Hamiltonian data, and (Q) is the derived conserved quantity. The kernel includes admissibility hypotheses (smoothness, invariance) and proof method (formal proof or certified computation).
Noether kernels are referenced by corridor policies requiring conserved structure and by certificates of coherence.
7.2.1.3 Topological kernel objects (homology, degree, winding)
Topological invariants are expressed as invariants of chain complexes, maps, and loops.
Definition 7.28 (Chain complex and homology). Let (C_\bullet) be a chain complex with boundary maps (\partial_k:C_k\to C_{k-1}) and (\partial_{k-1}\partial_k=0). The (k)-th homology is:[H_k(C_\bullet) := \ker(\partial_k)/\mathrm{Im}(\partial_{k+1}).]The Betti number (\beta_k := \dim H_k) (over a pinned field) is a topological invariant of the complex up to chain homotopy equivalence.
Definition 7.29 (Winding number). For a continuous loop (\gamma:S^1\to \mathbb C\setminus{0}), the winding number about 0 is:[\mathrm{wind}(\gamma) := \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{S^1} \frac{\gamma'(t)}{\gamma(t)},dt]when differentiable; discrete approximations require branch and sampling declarations.
Definition 7.30 (Degree). For a continuous map (f:S^n\to S^n), the degree (\deg(f)\in\mathbb Z) is a homotopy invariant. Computationally, degree can be evaluated via Jacobian sign integration for smooth maps or via combinatorial degree for simplicial maps, with pinned discretization and certificates.
These “topological kernels” are invariants that remain stable under continuous deformations, and therefore provide robust equivalence gates across representations that preserve the relevant topology.
7.2.1.4 Spectral kernel objects and index-like invariants
Spectral and index invariants are conjugacy-invariants used for classification and transport gating.
Definition 7.31 (Spectrum and spectral measure). For a normal operator (A) on a Hilbert space, define spectrum (\sigma(A)). For self-adjoint (A), define spectral measure (E(\lambda)) and functional calculus. For finite-dimensional (A), define eigenvalues (\lambda_i) with algebraic and geometric multiplicities.
Definition 7.32 (Spectral invariants). Standard spectral invariants include:
multiset of eigenvalues (with multiplicities),
trace and determinant (finite-dimensional or trace-class assumptions),
singular value spectrum,
spectral gaps and band edges,
inertia (counts of positive/negative/zero eigenvalues) for symmetric operators.
Definition 7.33 (Kernel multiplicity invariants). The dimension of the nullspace (\dim\ker(A)) is a spectral invariant and interfaces with Square structural kernels. In infinite-dimensional contexts, Fredholm index and related invariants require explicit admissibility (closed range, compact perturbations) and are treated as certified objects under corridor.
7.2.2 Calculus
7.2.2.1 Noether conservation and commutation criteria
Theorem 7.34 (Noether conservation, operational form). If a system admits symmetry group (G) and a conserved charge (Q) derived from a Noether kernel object, then along admissible trajectories:[\frac{d}{dt}Q(x(t))=0.]In operator language, for Hamiltonian (H) and observable (Q), conservation is implied by commutation:[[H,Q]=0]on the admissible domain. For approximate settings, commutator defect bounds control leakage of (Q).
Definition 7.35 (Charge leakage). For approximate evolution (\widetilde U_t), define:[\Delta_Q(t;S) := \sup_{x\in S}|Q(\widetilde U_t(x)) - Q(x)|.]Corridors map (\Delta_Q) into OK/NEAR/FAIL with explicit thresholds.
7.2.2.2 Topological invariance under admissible homotopies and transports
Topological invariants are preserved under structure-preserving transforms and continuous deformations.
Rule 7.36 (Homology invariance). If two complexes (C_\bullet) and (C'\bullet) are chain homotopy equivalent (with pinned chain maps and homotopies), then:[H_k(C\bullet)\cong H_k(C'_\bullet)\quad \forall k,]and (\beta_k) are equal. Any equivalence claim relying on homology must include the chain maps or a certified computation establishing isomorphism.
Rule 7.37 (Degree and winding invariance). Degree and winding are preserved under admissible homotopies that avoid singularities (e.g., (\gamma(t)\neq 0)). Any rotation/transport that crosses a branch cut or singularity invalidates the invariant unless the domain is refined to exclude the crossing or a tunneling mechanism is invoked (Chapters 11–15).
Topological invariants therefore function as strict guards against illegal transports: if a transform would alter winding or degree, it is either inadmissible on the region or must be explicitly labeled as a different regime.
7.2.2.3 Spectral invariance under conjugacy and perturbation bounds
Proposition 7.38 (Spectrum under conjugacy). For invertible (S), (\sigma(S^{-1}AS)=\sigma(A)). Thus eigenvalues and spectral multiplicities are invariants under admissible basis conjugacies.
Rule 7.39 (Spectral stability under perturbations). In NEAR corridors, approximate equivalence may be certified using spectral perturbation bounds:
eigenvalue perturbations bounded by operator norm perturbations in normal settings,
singular value perturbations bounded by (|A-\widetilde A|),with explicit assumptions and pinned theorems. Any use of perturbation theory must be encoded as a certificate obligation and recorded in the residual ledger.
7.2.2.4 Symmetry-coherent gating for equivalence edges
EQUIV/DUAL edges are gated by symmetry invariants.
Rule 7.40 (Symmetry gate). For an equivalence claim (A\sim B) under corridor (C), a symmetry gate requires:
matching symmetry invariants (group-invariant observables, class functions),
bounded commutator defects for conserved quantities if coherence is claimed,
bounded holonomy for gauge/phase conventions if the equivalence is established through loops,
preservation of discrete subgroup constraints if discrete symmetry is pinned.
Failure of any gate yields FAIL for strict corridors; uncertainty yields AMBIG with a plan to compute the missing invariants or to restrict the domain.
7.2.3 Algorithms
7.2.3.1 Compute symmetry invariants and commutator diagnostics
Algorithm 7.41 (ComputeSymmetrySignature). Input: object (A) (state/operator/presentation), symmetry data (G), invariant suite (\mathfrak I_\Omega), corridor. Output: symmetry signature and ledger entries.
Steps:
Validate symmetry declarations and domain invariance under generator set (\mathcal G).
Evaluate group-invariant observables (charges, norms, class functions).
If conservation is claimed, compute commutator defects (\Delta_{[H,Q]}) or charge leakage bounds via replay/test regime.
Store signature in canonical form; emit obligations for missing certificates (gauge-fixing, unitary/symplecticity, lattice subgroup membership).
7.2.3.2 Compute topological kernels (homology, winding, degree)
Algorithm 7.42 (ComputeHomology). Input: chain complex boundary matrices (\partial_k) over a pinned field, corridor. Output: Betti numbers (\beta_k) and representatives.
Steps:
Verify boundary condition (\partial_{k-1}\partial_k=0) (exact or within pinned tolerance if approximate complexes are permitted).

Compute phase increments with pinned branch unwrapping algorithm.

7.3 Cloud — Information invariants, divergences, and uncertainty monotones
7.3.1 Objects
7.3.1.1 Information functionals as invariants
Cloud invariants quantify information, uncertainty, and distributional structure.
Definition 7.47 (Entropy family). For a distribution (\mu) with density (p) (when applicable), define:
Shannon entropy (H(\mu)=-\int p\log p),
Rényi entropy (H_\alpha(\mu)=\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\log\int p^\alpha),
Tsallis entropy (T_\alpha(\mu)=\frac{1}{\alpha-1}(1-\int p^\alpha)),with domain admissibility conditions (integrability, absolute continuity) pinned.
Definition 7.48 (Divergence family). Divergences (D(\mu|\nu)\ge 0) include KL, reverse KL, JS, total variation, Wasserstein, (\chi^2), Rényi divergences, each with pinned domain requirements.
Information invariants may be:
exact under bijective transports,
monotone under coarse-graining (data processing),
decreasing under mixing (entropy production).
7.3.1.2 Stationarity and invariant distribution objects
Definition 7.49 (Invariant measure). For Markov kernel (K) or semigroup (P_t), (\pi) is invariant if (\pi K=\pi) or (\pi P_t=\pi). Stationarity objects include:
representation of (\pi),
admissibility conditions,
verification method (analytic, fixed-point solve, sampling diagnostics),
uniqueness/mixing obligations where required.
Stationarity is a gate: any claim about long-run behavior requires stationarity and mixing certificates appropriate to the corridor.
7.3.1.3 Martingale and optional-stopping invariants
Cloud invariants include martingale structures that remain invariant in expectation.
Definition 7.50 (Martingale). On a filtered probability space ((\Omega,\mathcal F,(\mathcal F_t),\mathbb P)), a process (M_t) is a martingale if:[\mathbb E[|M_t|]<\infty,\quad \mathbb E[M_t\mid \mathcal F_s]=M_s\ \text{for } s\le t.]Martingale invariants appear as conserved expectations or as unbiased estimators under stochastic flows.
Definition 7.51 (Optional stopping conditions). Optional stopping theorem conditions (bounded stopping times, uniform integrability) are treated as admissibility hypotheses; any use of optional stopping in a claim must cite these conditions and include certificates or obligations.
7.3.1.4 Risk and uncertainty ledger objects
Cloud invariants are embedded into the corridor truth system through risk and uncertainty ledgers (Chapter 4).
Definition 7.52 (Uncertainty invariant signature). A Cloud signature includes:
estimator bias/variance bounds,
tail regime classification and certificates,
identifiability cones/ridges,
propagation bounds through pipelines,all stored in canonical ledger normal form and referenced by claims.
7.3.2 Calculus
7.3.2.1 Data processing and invariance under bijections
Proposition 7.53 (Invariance under bijective transport). For a measurable bijection (T) with measurable inverse, divergences such as KL satisfy:[D(\mu|\nu)=D(T_#\mu|T_#\nu)]under admissibility conditions. Thus certain information quantities are invariants of coordinate rotation.
Rule 7.54 (Data processing inequality). For any Markov kernel (K),[D(\mu K|\nu K) \le D(\mu|\nu)]for f-divergences (under standard conditions). Therefore, coarse-graining and noisy channels destroy distinguishability; invariants become monotones. Corridors must treat claims of “information preservation” under non-invertible transforms as FAIL unless explicitly defined as a different invariant notion (e.g., sufficient statistic equivalence).
7.3.2.2 Entropy production and monotone decay under mixing
Definition 7.55 (Entropy production). For invariant measure (\pi) and evolution (\mu_t=\mu_0P_t),[\frac{d}{dt}\mathrm{KL}(\mu_t|\pi) = -\mathcal E(\mu_t)\le 0]under admissibility. Thus KL to equilibrium is a monotone for (\Sigma)-mixing.
Rule 7.56 (Mixing-to-bound conversion). If a corridor requires bounds on estimator error derived from mixing, it must pin which inequality is used (spectral gap, log-Sobolev, coupling) and require the corresponding certificate. Without such certificates, any inference depending on effective sample size remains AMBIG or NEAR, never OK.
7.3.2.3 Identifiability as an invariant boundary
Identifiability is not optional; it gates uniqueness.
Rule 7.57 (Identifiability gate). If a claim asserts a unique parameter or unique latent structure from observational data, then:
the corridor must require identifiability certificates,
absent identifiability, the claim must be reformulated as a statement about equivalence classes (set-valued semantics) or must be AMBIG with an evidence plan specifying additional observables.
7.3.2.4 Composition laws for probabilistic invariants
Cloud invariants compose via corridor-pinned uncertainty algebra.
Rule 7.58 (Confidence composition). When combining multiple probabilistic certificates with failure probabilities (\alpha_i), a conservative composition is:[\alpha_{\mathrm{total}}\le \sum_i \alpha_i,]unless an alternative rule is pinned and admissible. All composition assumptions must be stated.
Rule 7.59 (Propagation bound composition). For transformations with Lipschitz constants (L_i) and local errors (\epsilon_i),[\mathrm{Err}{\mathrm{out}} \le \sum{i=1}^n \left(\prod_{j=i+1}^n L_j\right)\epsilon_i,]with each constant and term certified or ledgered. Missing terms force AMBIG.
7.3.3 Algorithms
7.3.3.1 Estimation of entropies and divergences with certificates
Algorithm 7.60 (EstimateInformationFunctional). Input: sample stream, chosen functional (entropy/divergence), tail regime policy, corridor. Output: estimate + bound certificate + ledger.
Steps:
Determine admissible estimator class based on tail regime (plug-in, kNN, MOM, M-estimator).
Compute estimate with pinned randomness policy (if any).
Compute concentration bound consistent with tail regime and dependence (i.i.d. vs mixing).
Emit certificate record specifying assumptions and failure probability (\alpha).
If the corridor requires exact invariants and only approximate estimators are available, return AMBIG with evidence plan (increase sample, impose stronger assumptions, or reduce claim to NEAR).
7.3.3.2 Stationarity verification and invariant measure checks
Algorithm 7.61 (CheckStationarity). Input: kernel (K) or generator (L), candidate (\pi), corridor. Output: stationarity defect and certificate obligations.
Methods:
analytic: verify detailed balance or generator adjoint condition (when forms known),
numeric: compute (\Delta_\pi := d(\pi K,\pi)) by quadrature or discrete sums with verified bounds,
sampling: run long chain under pinned seed and test invariance of statistics with mixing diagnostics.
Outputs include:
stationarity defect ledger entry,
mixing obligations if long-run claims depend on sampling,
identifiability and tail regime flags.
7.3.3.3 Identifiability tests and evidence plan generation
Algorithm 7.62 (CloudIdentifiabilityTest). Input: observable map (\mathcal O(\theta)), data, metric, corridor. Output: identifiability verdict.
Steps:
Local sensitivity via Jacobian/Fisher proxies (pinned computation).
Global alias search under budgets (deterministic sampling or optimization with pinned initialization).
If aliasing detected, compute an alias cone description or equivalence class representation.
If undecidable under budget, return AMBIG with a finite evidence plan specifying new observables or interventions.
7.3.3.4 Uncertainty ledger automation for Cloud claims
Algorithm 7.63 (CloudLedgerAutomate). Input: claim (K), information/estimation pipeline artifacts, corridor. Output: VNF ledger entries and obligations.
Rules:
every estimator introduces bias/variance terms that must be ledgered,
every tail assumption must be supported by a tail certificate or creates an obligation,
every dependence assumption (mixing) must be supported or yields an obligation,
identifiability must be certified or forces AMBIG/set-valued outcome.
Ledger automation is deterministic and generates minimal obligation sets required to close the claim under the corridor.

7.4 Fractal — Scale invariants, universality suites, and multiscale kernels
7.4.1 Objects
7.4.1.1 Scale ladders and invariant families across resolution
Fractal invariants are indexed by scale and persist across coarse-graining.
Definition 7.64 (Scale-indexed invariant family). Let (\epsilon\in\mathcal E) index resolution. A scale-indexed invariant family is:[{I_\epsilon}{\epsilon\in\mathcal E},\quad I\epsilon:X_\epsilon\to \mathcal Y_\epsilon,]together with comparison maps (\pi_{\epsilon\to\epsilon'}:\mathcal Y_\epsilon\to \mathcal Y_{\epsilon'}) enabling cross-scale comparisons and stability statements.
Definition 7.65 (Scale stability). The family is stable along a refinement ladder (\epsilon_0\succ \epsilon_1\succ\cdots) if:[d_{\epsilon_k}\Big(I_{\epsilon_k}(x_{\epsilon_k}),\ \pi_{\epsilon_{k+1}\to\epsilon_k}(I_{\epsilon_{k+1}}(x_{\epsilon_{k+1}}))\Big)\le b_k,]with (b_k\downarrow 0) under a corridor-pinned tightening schedule.
7.4.1.2 Universality invariants and exponent objects
Universality invariants characterize equivalence classes under coarse-graining.
Definition 7.66 (Universality suite). A universality suite is a record:[\mathfrak U := (\mathcal E,\ {\mathcal O_\epsilon},\ {I_\epsilon},\ {\varepsilon_\epsilon},\ \mathrm{FixedPointObjects},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]where (\mathcal O_\epsilon) are observable families at each scale, and (I_\epsilon) include:
scaling exponents,
renormalized spectra,
fixed-point parameter values,
invariant distributions up to rescaling.
Definition 7.67 (Exponent object). An exponent object is:[\mathcal X := (\theta^\star,\ L=D\mathcal R(\theta^\star),\ {(\lambda_i,v_i)},\ {\alpha_i},\ \mathrm{Region},\ \mathrm{Certs}),]where (\alpha_i) are scaling exponents derived from eigenvalues or renormalization relations, with admissibility region and certificates.
7.4.1.3 Multiscale kernel objects and coarse/fine projections
Topological kernels in Fractal form include persistent structures across scales.
Definition 7.68 (Persistent kernel). Given a filtration (nested spaces or complexes) indexed by scale, define persistent homology groups (H_k^\epsilon) and persistence diagrams. Persistence objects encode how kernel-like invariants (cycles, holes) appear/disappear across scales. When used, all discretization and field choices must be pinned and certified.
Definition 7.69 (Coarse/fine projectors). Restriction/prolongation pairs ((R_\epsilon,P_\epsilon)) are treated as transforms with RP/PR consistency obligations (Chapter 6.4). These projectors enable comparison of invariants across scales and are included in Fractal suites.
7.4.1.4 Seeded invariant signatures and compression objects
Fractal invariants are stored as seeds to enable regeneration and to prevent drift.
Definition 7.70 (Invariant seed). An invariant seed is a compact object containing:
the invariant suite definition,
canonical evaluation order,
pinned scale ladder,
commitments to required certificates and replay harness,
cached invariant signatures at selected anchor scales,
expansion procedure to regenerate detailed invariant reports.
Invariant seeds satisfy idempotent compress/expand under pinned policy:[\mathrm{Compress}(\mathrm{Expand}(\mathfrak s))=\mathfrak s.]
7.4.2 Calculus
7.4.2.1 RG invariance and fixed-point gating
Fractal equivalence is governed by renormalization structure.
Rule 7.71 (Fixed-point gate). If a corridor defines equivalence by attraction to the same RG fixed point, then objects (A,B) pass the fixed-point gate if:
their RG iterates converge to fixed points (\theta_A^\star,\theta_B^\star),
(d(\theta_A^\star,\theta_B^\star)\le \varepsilon_{\theta}) under pinned metric,
their relevant exponent objects match within scale tolerances,
contraction in irrelevant subspace is certified to justify forgetting irrelevant degrees.
Without contraction certificates, fixed-point matching may justify NEAR but not OK.
7.4.2.2 Universality as scale-indexed equivalence relation
Definition 7.72 (Universality equivalence). Two presentations (\mathcal P,\mathcal Q) are universal-equivalent under suite (\mathfrak U) if for all (\epsilon\in\mathcal E),[\Delta_\epsilon(\mathcal P,\mathcal Q) := d_{\mathrm{obs}}\big(\mathcal O_\epsilon(\mathcal P),\ \mathcal O_\epsilon(\mathcal Q)\big)\le \varepsilon_\epsilon,]and cross-scale coherence conditions hold (twist/commutation bounds between rotations and coarse-grain maps).
Universality equivalence is explicitly weaker than exact equivalence; corridors must state which downstream inferences may use universality equivalence as a substitute for exactness.
7.4.2.3 Scale-dependent budgets and invariant tightening schedules
Rule 7.73 (Tightening schedule). Fractal corridors include scale-dependent tolerances (\varepsilon_\epsilon) and budgets (B(\epsilon)) that tighten with refinement. Any promotion of truth values under refinement must satisfy the tightened budgets, and any claim transported from coarse to fine must include propagation bounds.
7.4.2.4 Failure modes: noncommutation, drift, and false universality
Fractal invariants fail in structured ways.
Definition 7.74 (Scale-rotation twist defect). For coarse-grain map (R) and rotation (T), define:[\Delta_{\mathrm{twist}} := \sup_{x\in S} d\big((R\circ T)(x), (T'\circ R)(x)\big),]where (T') is the induced coarse rotation when it exists. Large twist indicates representation is not stable under coarse-graining and invalidates universality gates unless explicitly modeled.
Definition 7.75 (Invariant drift). Drift occurs when invariant signatures change across scales beyond budgets:[d(I_{\epsilon_{k+1}}, I_{\epsilon_k}) > b_k,]signaling missing certificates, insufficient resolution, or genuine non-universality.
Rule 7.76 (False universality). Claims of universality are FAIL if:
twist defects exceed corridor thresholds by certified lower bounds,
invariants match only due to insufficient observables or truncation artifacts,
contraction hypotheses are absent yet used implicitly to justify equivalence.
False universality triggers quarantine escalation under Fractal corridors.
7.4.3 Algorithms
7.4.3.1 Compute scale-indexed invariant suites

Evaluate twist defects between coarse-grain and rotation routes used.

CHAPTER 7 — INVARIANTS: CONSERVATION, MONOTONES, TOPOLOGICAL KERNELS (Addr ⟨0012⟩₄)
Chapter 8 — Seed Forging & Zero-Calculus ((\pi,e,i,\varphi\ \text{as constraint objects})) (Addr ⟨0013⟩₄)
8.1 Square — Zero sets, constraint systems, and forged constants
8.1.1 Objects
8.1.1.1 Zero-object schema and constant objects ((\pi,e,i,\varphi))
The Square lens defines zero-calculus as the primary mechanism by which constants, laws, and invariants are forged into compact, reusable semantic atoms.
Definition 8.1 (Zero presentation). A zero presentation is a presentation (Chapter 2)[\mathcal Z := (X,\ H,\ \mathbb V,\ {0},\ \mathrm{Dom},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]where (H:\mathrm{Dom}\to \mathbb V) is an evaluation map into a value space (\mathbb V) with distinguished target ({0}). The zero set is[\mathsf Z(\mathcal Z) := {x\in \mathrm{Dom}:\ H(x)=0}.]
Definition 8.2 (Zero object). A zero object is the triple[Z := (\mathcal Z,\ S,\ \mathrm{Witness}),]where:
(\mathcal Z) is a zero presentation,
(S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}) is the declared working region,
Witness is a proof-carrying artifact that establishes one of:
existence of a zero in (S),
uniqueness of the zero in (S),
an isolating enclosure (interval/ball) containing the zero,
stability and hardened properties (8.1.1.4).
A zero object is not a value; it is a certified semantic entity that can be transported and used as a dependency in other claims.
Definition 8.3 (Constant object). A constant object is a zero object equipped with a canonical naming and extraction interface:[\mathrm{Const} := (Z,\ \mathrm{Name},\ \mathrm{Rep},\ \mathrm{Aliases},\ \mathrm{EquivClass}),]where:
Name ∈ ({\pi,e,i,\varphi,\dots}),
Rep specifies the chosen canonical representative presentation used for storage,
Aliases are other admissible presentations linked by equivalence edges (Chapter 5, Kind=EQUIV),
EquivClass is a set of presentations certified equivalent under corridor policies.
Definition 8.4 (Canonical constant presentations). The manuscript treats the canonical constants as instances of the zero-object schema by pinning at least one admissible zero presentation for each:
(i): a zero of (H(z)=z^2+1) in (\mathbb C) under a pinned branch convention.
(\varphi): a zero of (H(x)=x^2-x-1) in (\mathbb R) with region (S=(1,2)) to isolate the positive root.
(e): a zero of a pinned defining residual (H(x)) derived from an admissible characterization (e.g., inverse of the integral defining (\log), or an exponential fixed-point constraint) with a certified isolating region.
(\pi): a zero-derived characterization pinned by a presentation equivalence class (e.g., smallest positive root of (\sin(x)) under a pinned trigonometric system, or an integral/geometry-derived constraint with certified equivalence).
The framework does not privilege one definition as “the” definition; it stores a canonical representative and binds others by certified transport (Chapters 3–5).
8.1.1.2 Multiway constraint systems and intersection objects
Many laws and constants arise as multiway intersections rather than single equations.
Definition 8.5 (Multiway constraint system). A multiway constraint system is a tuple of constraints[\mathbf H := (H_1,\ldots,H_m),\qquad H_j:\mathrm{Dom}\to \mathbb V_j,]with combined map[H(x):=(H_1(x),\ldots,H_m(x))\in \mathbb V:=\prod_{j=1}^m \mathbb V_j,]and zero set[\mathsf Z(\mathbf H) := {x\in \mathrm{Dom}:\ H_j(x)=0\ \forall j}.]
Definition 8.6 (Intersection object). An intersection object is[\mathcal I := (\mathbf H,\ \mathrm{Dom},\ S,\ \mathrm{TransversalityData},\ \mathrm{Witness}),]where TransversalityData encodes the rank/regularity conditions used to justify isolation, uniqueness, or manifold structure of the intersection. In finite dimensions, a typical sufficient condition for an isolated solution (x^\star) is full rank of the Jacobian of (H) at (x^\star).
Definition 8.7 (Constraint kernel as a module). The constraint kernel module is the subgraph of the MyceliumGraph containing:
the defining presentations (H_j),
admissibility guards and branch declarations,
the chosen solver templates,
the certificates establishing existence/uniqueness/stability,sealed as a module (Chapter 5.4) so it can be imported without re-deriving the entire proof chain.
8.1.1.3 Isolation regions, admissibility guards, and singularity exclusions
Zero-calculus is valid only on declared admissible regions. Domain and branch constraints are inseparable from the zero object.
Definition 8.8 (Isolation region). An isolation region (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}) is a set on which the zero object is claimed to be isolated. Examples:
intervals ([a,b]\subset \mathbb R),
balls (B(x_0,r)\subset \mathbb R^n) or (\mathbb C^n),
compact sets defined by inequalities,
product regions in multi-parameter problems.
Definition 8.9 (Admissibility guards). Guards for zero-calculus include:
branch guards: prevent crossing branch cuts for multivalued primitives,
singularity guards: exclude points where (H) is undefined or loses regularity,
conditioning guards: enforce bounded condition numbers or Jacobian nondegeneracy on (S),
feasibility guards: maintain inequality constraints and boundary conditions.
Definition 8.10 (Singularity exclusion set). A singularity exclusion set is[\Sigma_H := {x\in X:\ H \text{ undefined or non-admissible at } x},]and the admissible domain is (\mathrm{Dom}\subseteq X\setminus \Sigma_H), pinned explicitly. Any attempt to “simplify” (H) that changes (\Sigma_H) is a change of meaning unless certified (Chapter 2.1.2.2).
8.1.1.4 Hardened zeros and jet constraints
A zero object can be strengthened into a hardened zero, making it stable under transformations and perturbations and suitable as a “seed core” for further constructions.
Definition 8.11 (Order-(k) jet). Let (H:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^m) be (C^k). The order-(k) jet at (x) is:[J^kH(x) := {D^\alpha H(x):|\alpha|\le k}.]
Definition 8.12 (Hardened zero of order (k)). A zero (x^\star\in \mathsf Z(H)) is hardened of order (k) if:
(H(x^\star)=0),
specified derivatives satisfy pinned constraints (e.g., nondegenerate Jacobian at (k=1), or higher-order conditions),
the hardness certificate supplies quantitative bounds on derivatives over the isolation region.
Canonical hardness modes:
Isolation hardness (order 1): (DH(x^\star)) is invertible (or has full rank) and bounded away from singularity in a neighborhood.
Multiplicity hardness (higher order): constraints on higher derivatives certify multiplicity or enforce curvature bounds for stable continuation.
Constraint-hardening: multiway constraints include additional jet constraints to prevent cancellation artifacts and enforce structural uniqueness.
Definition 8.13 (Hardened zero presentation). A hardened zero may be expressed as a multiway constraint system:[\mathbf H_{\mathrm{hard}}(x)=\big(H(x),\ C_1(J^kH(x)),\ldots,C_r(J^kH(x))\big)=0,]with explicit admissibility conditions ensuring the jet is well-defined.
Hardened zeros are the preferred storage objects for constants and operator seeds because they support robust transport, stable replay, and controlled perturbation analysis.
8.1.2 Calculus
8.1.2.1 Zero-set calculus and solution manifolds
Zero-sets may be isolated points or manifolds; the calculus distinguishes these cases explicitly.
Definition 8.14 (Regular value and implicit manifold). Let (H:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^m) be (C^1). If (x^\star\in \mathsf Z(H)) and (DH(x^\star)) has full rank (m), then near (x^\star), (\mathsf Z(H)) is a (C^1) manifold of dimension (n-m). If (n=m), the zero is isolated and locally unique.
Rule 8.15 (Isolation gate). A zero object may be used as a constant (a scalar semantic atom) only if:
the intended semantic is an isolated solution, and
the witness certifies uniqueness in an isolation region (S) (or isolates the solution by an enclosure method).If the zero set has positive dimension, the object must be treated as a parameterized family or a constraint manifold, and any downstream dependency must state whether it depends on the entire manifold or on a selected representative (requiring gauge/selection objects and certificates).
8.1.2.2 Multiway intersections, transversality, and cancellation discipline
Multiway systems require discipline to avoid spurious solutions.
Rule 8.16 (Intersection vs cancellation). For constraints (H_1=0,\ldots,H_m=0), the intersection zero set is:[\bigcap_{j=1}^m \mathsf Z(H_j).]Any rewrite that replaces ({H_j}) by a combined constraint (\widetilde H) is admissible only if it preserves the intersection set on the declared region; in particular:
replacing ((H_1,H_2)=0) by (H_1H_2=0) is invalid (it yields union, not intersection),
squaring constraints may introduce spurious solutions when sign matters or when inequalities are present,
dividing by expressions that can vanish changes the domain and is invalid unless guarded.
Definition 8.17 (Transversality witness). For (H:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^m), a transversality witness in a region (S) includes a bound:[\inf_{x\in S}\ \sigma_{\min}(DH(x)) \ge \gamma > 0](or a rank certificate in exact settings), ensuring the system is well-conditioned and that the zero is isolated/regular as intended.
Rule 8.18 (Transversality as an admissibility gate). In strict corridors, equivalence edges that claim “same zero” across presentations require transversality witnesses on the working region to prevent branch-induced or cancellation-induced drift in the inferred solution.
8.1.2.3 Stability under perturbations and hardness propagation
A forged constant must be stable under small perturbations of the defining constraint and under allowed transports.
Definition 8.19 (Perturbation model). A perturbation of (H) is (H+\delta H) with:[|\delta H|_{\mathcal B(S)} \le \eta,]in a pinned function norm on region (S) (sup norm, Lipschitz norm, Sobolev norm, or operator norm, depending on type).
Proposition 8.20 (Local stability for nondegenerate zeros). If (H(x^\star)=0) and (DH(x^\star)) is invertible with (|DH(x^\star)^{-1}|\le \kappa), then for sufficiently small perturbations (\delta H), there exists a unique perturbed zero (x^\star_{\delta}) near (x^\star), and:[|x^\star_{\delta}-x^\star| \le \kappa, |\delta H(x^\star)| + \text{higher-order terms},]under pinned norms and regularity assumptions.
Rule 8.21 (Hardness propagation). If a zero object is hardened with bounds on derivatives over an isolation region, then:
transport of the defining constraint by admissible conjugacy (Chapter 3) preserves hardness when the transform is regular on the region,
the hardness certificate must include the transformed bounds (or a bound propagation proof) to retain OK status after rotation.
8.1.2.4 Seed semantics: “store in, not out” as a formal compression contract
Seeds compress the generating structure of a constant or law without storing an exhaustive expansion.
Definition 8.22 (Seed). A seed is a content-addressed object:[\mathfrak s := (\mathrm{SeedID},\ \mathrm{SeedNF},\ \mathrm{SeedHash}),]where SeedNF contains:
a canonical representative presentation (\mathcal Z) (in RNF/PNF),
isolation region (S),
admissibility guards and branch declarations,
solver template identifier and pinned kernel IDs,
minimal witness set pointers (proof/test/replay),
invariant suite and defect specs needed to certify equivalence to other definitions,
expansion recipe describing how to regenerate derived artifacts (expressions, approximations, alternate presentations) from the seed.
Definition 8.23 (Compression contract). A seed satisfies a compression contract if for pinned policy (\Pi),[\mathrm{Compress}\Pi(\mathrm{Expand}\Pi(\mathfrak s))=\mathfrak s,]and (\mathrm{Expand}_\Pi(\mathfrak s)) yields a complete set of artifacts required by the corridor to reproduce the constant’s canonical claims (existence/uniqueness/bounds), including replay transcripts.
“Store in, not out” is therefore a strict semantic contract: the seed is the smallest object that can regenerate the full proof-carrying structure when expanded.
8.1.3 Algorithms
8.1.3.1 Normalize constraints into zero-normal form and isolation-ready form
Algorithm 8.24 (NormalizeToZeroNF). Input: constraint object (\mathcal C) intended to define a constant/law. Output: zero presentation (\mathcal Z) in RNF with explicit domain/branch declarations.
Stages:
Parse (\mathcal C) into typed AST and identify target semantics (equality, fixed point, extremum, integral identity).
Convert to a zero map (H) using typed difference operators; forbid cancellation rewrites unless guarded/certified.
Declare (\mathrm{Dom}) including branch guards and singularity exclusions.
Pin the value space (\mathbb V), target ({0}), and residual metric (|H(x)|) or distance-to-target.
Generate or require an isolation region (S) (interval/ball), either provided by the user or derived by coarse bounding methods with obligations.
Output is a zero presentation suitable for solver compilation and certification.
8.1.3.2 Forge isolated zeros: enclosure, existence, uniqueness
Algorithm 8.25 (ForgeIsolatedZero). Input: (\mathcal Z=(X,H,\mathbb V,{0},\mathrm{Dom})), isolation region (S), corridor (C). Output: zero object (Z) with witness artifacts.
Supported forging modes (pinned by corridor):
Enclosure mode (interval/ball methods): compute an enclosure (E\subseteq S) guaranteed to contain a zero; optionally refine to isolate uniqueness.
Contraction mode: construct a map (F) whose fixed point is a zero of (H) and certify contraction on (S).
Monotone bracketing mode (1D): certify sign change and continuity on ([a,b]) and apply bisection with certified bounds.
Validated Newton/Kantorovich mode: use derivative bounds to certify existence and uniqueness in a neighborhood.
Each mode produces:
a witness of existence (e.g., sign change certificate, contraction proof, interval evaluation),
a witness of uniqueness (derivative bound or contraction),
an enclosure artifact,
a replay transcript for the forging computation.
8.1.3.3 Harden zeros via derivative bounds and jet constraints
Algorithm 8.26 (HardenZero). Input: zero object (Z) with candidate (x^\star), desired hardness mode (k), corridor (C). Output: hardened zero object (Z_{\mathrm{hard}}).
Steps:
Choose hardness target:
order-1 invertibility hardness: bound (\sigma_{\min}(DH)) on an enclosure,
higher-order hardness: bound derivatives up to order (k) on the enclosure.
Compute derivative bounds by pinned method:
analytic symbolic bounds,
verified numeric bounds (interval arithmetic),
replay-based bounds on a pinned net with safety margins (only if corridor permits).
If full-rank/invertibility cannot be certified, downgrade to AMBIG with evidence plan or treat solution as non-isolated manifold (requires a different semantic object).
Emit hardness certificate and update seed payload to include derivative bound artifacts.
Hardened zeros are the default units stored for constants under strict corridors.
8.1.3.4 Seed forging pipeline: build, seal, and register
Algorithm 8.27 (ForgeSeed). Input: constant name (optional), zero object (Z), corridor set ({C_i}), canonical representative selection rule. Output: seed (\mathfrak s) registered as a corpus atom.
Pipeline:
Select canonical representative. Choose the RNF presentation (\mathcal Z) that minimizes dependency surface (fewest external pins), maximizes admissibility clarity (explicit branches), and admits the strongest certificates under the target corridor.
Assemble witness core. Extract minimal witness set supporting:
existence/uniqueness/enclosure,
domain/branch admissibility,
hardness bounds (if required),
replay determinism for all computations.
Attach equivalence links (optional but canonical for (\pi,e,i,\varphi)). For each alternate known presentation (\mathcal Z'), create EQUIV edges gated by invariant suites and defect bounds; include commuting diagram obligations if multiple rotation routes exist.
Seal seed. Construct SeedNF with:
(\mathcal Z), (S), domain/branch declarations,
solver template and kernel IDs,
witness pointers and replay pointers,
invariant suite gating requirements,
expansion recipe specifying how to regenerate approximations and alternate expressions deterministically.
Register. Emit the seed as a GlobalAddr atom, create registry entries and REF edges for downstream dependencies, and run regression suite to ensure stability.
The seed is now a canonical proof-carrying constant/law object.
8.1.4 Certificates
8.1.4.1 Existence and enclosure certs
Existence/enclosure certificates assert that the zero set intersects the declared region and provides a concrete enclosure.
Certificate forms:
sign-change + continuity cert for 1D bracketing,
contraction mapping cert (existence and uniqueness),
interval evaluation cert producing a validated enclosure,
topological degree cert (when used) asserting existence within region.
Required fields:
domain/branch admissibility on the enclosure,
explicit evaluation method and replay transcript,
enclosure object in canonical normal form.
8.1.4.2 Uniqueness and isolation certs
Uniqueness certificates establish that exactly one solution lies in the declared isolation region.
Sufficient certificate modes:
derivative invertibility bound on the region (Kantorovich-style),
contraction constant < 1 on the region for a fixed-point formulation,
strict monotonicity certificate in 1D,
transversality certificate for multiway systems with (n=m).
Uniqueness certs must explicitly state:
the region (S),
the admissibility guards,
the quantitative bound ((\gamma>0), (\kappa<1), etc.).
8.1.4.3 Hardness and stability certs
Hardness certificates bind derivative/jet constraints to stability guarantees.
Contents:
order of hardness (k),
derivative bounds on an enclosure,
perturbation stability bounds (how much (H) may change without losing existence/uniqueness),
transport stability bounds under admissible transforms (how bounds propagate).
Hardness certs are required for using the zero object as a stable generator in subsequent constructions (e.g., building operator expansions dependent on the constant).
8.1.4.4 Seed integrity certs (compression contract and replay closure)
Seed integrity certificates establish that the seed satisfies the compression contract and is replay-closed under corridor.
Contents:
SeedNF hash commitments,
proof that Expand regenerates:
the canonical presentation,
the enclosure/uniqueness/hardness certificates,
the replay transcripts and witness manifests,
the equivalence links and invariant gates required under corridor.
proof that Compress(Expand(seed)) returns the identical seed (idempotence),
proof that all dependencies resolve under closure predicates (Chapter 4),
regression stability statement under pinned kernel versions.
8.2 Flower — Equivalence classes of definitions and conjugacy-stable seeds
8.2.1 Objects
8.2.1.1 Definition families and equivalence-class objects
A constant/law is not a single presentation; it is an equivalence class of presentations connected by certified transports.
Definition 8.28 (Definition family). A definition family for a constant (c) is a set of zero presentations:[\mathcal F(c) := {\mathcal Z_\alpha}{\alpha\in A},]where each (\mathcal Z\alpha) is admissible on a declared region (S_\alpha) and defines the same semantic entity under certified equivalence.
Definition 8.29 (Equivalence class object). An equivalence class object is:[[c] := (\mathcal F(c),\ {\mathrm{EQUIV\ edges}},\ \mathrm{InvariantSuite},\ \mathrm{NormalForms},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]with EQUIV edges storing transforms, domains, invariant gates, and defect bounds.
This object is the Flower-layer view of a constant: invariance under conjugacy and symmetry becomes the defining principle.
8.2.1.2 Conjugacy invariants for zero objects
Conjugacy is the primitive symmetry of the rotation calculus; seeds must respect it.
Definition 8.30 (Conjugacy-stable zero). A zero object (Z) is conjugacy-stable on region (S) if for every admissible transform (T) in the permitted transform family:
the transported zero presentation (\mathcal Z^{(T)}) is admissible on (T(S)),
the transported zero set corresponds exactly:[T(\mathsf Z(\mathcal Z)\cap S)=\mathsf Z(\mathcal Z^{(T)})\cap T(S),]
the invariant suite used to gate equivalence is preserved under (T) (e.g., kernel cardinality, winding/degree, spectral signature).
Conjugacy stability is a required property for seeds that must survive representation changes without semantic drift.
8.2.1.3 Duality and symmetry objects for constants
Constants often carry symmetry/duality structure:
complex conjugation symmetry for (i)-related constructs,
algebraic conjugates for polynomial-defined constants (e.g., (\varphi) and its conjugate),
functional dualities linking integral and differential definitions.
Definition 8.31 (Duality object for a constant). A duality object is:[\mathcal D := (\mathcal Z_\alpha,\ \mathcal Z_\beta,\ T_{\alpha\to\beta},\ \mathrm{SymmetryData},\ \mathrm{InvariantGate},\ \mathrm{Witness}),]where (T_{\alpha\to\beta}) is an admissible transport and SymmetryData includes involutions (e.g., conjugation) and allowed gauge conventions. Duality objects serve as canonical bridges between distinct-looking definitions of the same constant.
8.2.1.4 Diagram witnesses and holonomy records for definition cycles
Definition families can form cycles; coherence requires commuting diagrams and bounded holonomy.
Definition 8.32 (Definition cycle). A definition cycle is a loop of EQUIV/DUAL edges:[\mathcal Z_{\alpha_0}\to \mathcal Z_{\alpha_1}\to \cdots \to \mathcal Z_{\alpha_k}=\mathcal Z_{\alpha_0}.]
Definition 8.33 (Holonomy for definition cycles). The holonomy defect is the defect of the composed transport relative to identity on a pinned region. Nonzero holonomy indicates inconsistent branch conventions, missing guards, or genuine obstructions. Holonomy records are mandatory for strict corridors that permit multi-route canonicalization.
8.2.2 Calculus
8.2.2.1 Equivalence of zero objects under admissible transport
Rule 8.34 (Zero equivalence under transport). Two zero presentations (\mathcal Z_X=(X,H_X)) and (\mathcal Z_Y=(Y,H_Y)) are equivalent on region (S\subseteq X) under transform (T:X\leftrightarrow Y) if:
admissibility holds on (S),
the transported evaluation matches:[H_Y(y)=H_X(T^{-1}(y)) \quad \text{on } T(S),]or matches within corridor tolerances under a pinned defect metric,
the zero sets correspond on the region:[T(\mathsf Z(\mathcal Z_X)\cap S)=\mathsf Z(\mathcal Z_Y)\cap T(S),]
invariants required by the corridor gate match (Chapter 7).
Equivalence is established by EQUIV edges with explicit witnesses and replay transcripts (Chapters 3–5).
8.2.2.2 Symmetry constraints and branch coherence in constant definitions
Rule 8.35 (Branch coherence). Any equivalence between definitions that rely on multivalued primitives must include:
identical branch conventions on overlapping domains, or
a certified branch translation map, plus explicit domain refinements avoiding branch cut crossings.
Branch inconsistency is treated as:
FAIL if it changes the semantic object,
AMBIG if multiple branch-consistent interpretations exist and must be represented as a CandidateSet.
8.2.2.3 Conjugacy-class invariants as gates for seed transport
Rule 8.36 (Conjugacy gate). For a seed (\mathfrak s) and a candidate transport route (\rho), the route is admissible only if:
the invariants in the seed’s invariant suite are conjugacy-class invariants under the route,
the route preserves those invariants within corridor thresholds,
diagram commutation obligations close for alternative routes (when present).
This rule ensures that seeds remain stable across representation changes and prevents silent drift.
8.2.2.4 Normal-form selection for canonical representatives
Rule 8.37 (Canonical representative selection). Given a definition family (\mathcal F(c)), a canonical representative is chosen by a pinned selection functional:[\mathcal Z^\star := \arg\min_{\mathcal Z_\alpha\in\mathcal F(c)} \Big(\mathrm{Surface}(\mathcal Z_\alpha) + \lambda,\mathrm{Risk}(\mathcal Z_\alpha) + \mu,\mathrm{Cost}(\mathcal Z_\alpha)\Big),]where:
Surface counts dependency closure size and external pins,
Risk aggregates branch and admissibility complexity,
Cost estimates replay compute costs,and (\lambda,\mu) are corridor-pinned weights.
Ties are broken deterministically (lexicographic by GlobalAddrNF and presentation NF). The selection is recorded in the seed’s metadata and is itself auditable.
8.2.3 Algorithms
8.2.3.1 Build equivalence graphs for constant definition families
Algorithm 8.38 (BuildDefinitionEquivalenceGraph). Input: candidate definition presentations ({\mathcal Z_\alpha}), permitted transform library, corridor (C). Output: equivalence graph with EQUIV/DUAL edges, commuting diagram obligations, and holonomy audits.
Steps:
Normalize all presentations to RNF and compute basic invariant signatures.
For each pair ((\alpha,\beta)), search for admissible transforms (T) (direct or chained) that could relate them.
Apply invariant gates to prune; for surviving candidates, attempt to certify equivalence by constructing EQUIV edges.
For multi-route relations, build commuting diagram witnesses and compute defects.
Detect cycles and compute holonomy residuals under pinned budgets.
Quarantine inconsistencies; produce conflict packets if obstructions arise.
8.2.3.2 Canonicalize definition cycles and eliminate gauge drift
Algorithm 8.39 (CanonicalizeDefinitionCycles). Input: equivalence graph, pinned gauge/branch conventions, corridor. Output: canonical routes and gauge-fixing records.
Steps:
Choose canonical gauge/branch conventions for each presentation (phase/branch normalization).
Re-evaluate commuting diagrams under these conventions.
If holonomy is nonzero, localize drift and refine domains or adjust gauge via allowed moves.
Emit holonomy-boundedness certificates or obstruction packages.
8.2.3.3 Transport hardened zeros across representations
Algorithm 8.40 (TransportHardenedZero). Input: hardened zero object (Z_{\mathrm{hard}}), transform (T), corridor. Output: transported hardened zero object (Z^{(T)}_{\mathrm{hard}}) with propagated hardness bounds.
Steps:
Verify admissibility of (T) on the isolation region and branch coherence.
Transport the defining map (H) and the isolation region.
Propagate derivative bounds using chain rule and bound propagation inequalities; record distortion constants.
If propagation cannot be certified, downgrade to AMBIG with evidence plan or to NEAR if corridor permits bounded but incomplete propagation.
8.2.3.4 Assemble canonical seed from an equivalence class
Algorithm 8.41 (AssembleCanonicalSeedFromClass). Input: equivalence class object ([c]), corridor family, selection rule. Output: seed (\mathfrak s_c).
Steps:
Select canonical representative (\mathcal Z^\star).
Attach the minimal witness set for existence/uniqueness/hardness.
Attach the minimal subgraph of equivalence edges needed to regenerate the definition family (optional expansions controlled by seed recipe).
Attach invariant suite gating requirements and any required holonomy certificates.
Seal and register seed; emit regression certificates ensuring stable identity across editions.
8.2.4 Certificates
8.2.4.1 Equivalence class closure certs
Certify that the definition family is internally coherent and closed under declared equivalence edges.
Contents:
list of presentations in the class,
list of EQUIV/DUAL edges and their corridor statuses,
commuting diagram witnesses for multi-route equivalences,
proof that equivalence is transitive on the declared regions (via composition closure and commutation).
8.2.4.2 Branch/gauge coherence certs
Certify branch and gauge coherence across the class:
branch cut exclusions and translation maps,
phase/frame normalization conventions,
bounded holonomy for cycles,
explicit domain refinements used to maintain coherence.
8.2.4.3 Conjugacy-stability certs for hardened zeros
Certify that hardened zeros remain hardened under permitted transports:
admissibility of transports on isolation regions,
propagated derivative bounds and distortion constants,
preserved invariant suites and kernel structure,
replay transcripts validating transport correctness.
8.2.4.4 Canonical representative and seed selection certs
Certify that the canonical representative choice is deterministic and policy-compliant:
selection functional definition and weights,
computed selection outcome and tie-break resolution,
proof that selected representative satisfies required corridor constraints,
proof that seed closure and replay determinism hold.
8.3 Cloud — Uncertain zeros, stochastic forging, and probabilistic certification
8.3.1 Objects
8.3.1.1 Noisy constraint systems and stochastic zero objects
In many regimes, constraint evaluation is noisy or only accessible via sampling/estimation.
Definition 8.42 (Noisy zero system). A noisy zero system is specified by a random evaluation map:[\widehat H(x;\omega),\quad \mathbb E[\widehat H(x;\omega)] = H(x),]with a pinned error model describing variance, tails, and dependence.
Definition 8.43 (Stochastic zero object). A stochastic zero object is:[Z_{\Sigma} := (\mathcal Z,\ S,\ \mathrm{EstimatorSpec},\ \mathrm{ConfidenceSpec},\ \mathrm{Witness}),]where Witness establishes existence/uniqueness in probabilistic terms:
existence with probability at least (1-\alpha),
uniqueness modulo an identifiability cone,
enclosures given as confidence regions.
Stochastic zero objects are never OK under corridors that require exactness unless the corridor defines OK probabilistically with pinned confidence semantics.
8.3.1.2 Confidence regions, credible enclosures, and risk records
Definition 8.44 (Confidence enclosure). A confidence enclosure is a region (E\subseteq S) such that:[\mathbb P(x^\star\in E)\ge 1-\alpha,]under pinned assumptions and estimator procedures. Enclosures can be intervals, balls, or level sets of estimated residuals.
Definition 8.45 (Risk record). A risk record stores:
bias/variance decomposition of the estimator,
tail regime certificate,
dependence/mixing certificates for sampling processes,
identifiability/aliasing flags,and is attached to the residual ledger (Chapter 4) as a required component of NEAR claims.
8.3.1.3 Likelihood-to-zero compilation for constants and parameters
Definition 8.46 (Likelihood zero form). Given likelihood (p_\theta(D)), define:[H(\theta) := \nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(D)](score equation) or[H(\theta) := \theta - \mathrm{ArgMax}(\log p_\theta(D))](fixed-point form), with explicit admissibility conditions and identifiability requirements. These are compiled into zero objects with stochastic certification obligations.
8.3.1.4 Uncertainty ledgers for seed forging
Cloud seeds must include uncertainty ledgers when derived from stochastic evidence.
Definition 8.47 (Stochastic seed). A stochastic seed includes, in addition to deterministic seed fields:
confidence parameters (\alpha),
estimator specifications and pinned randomness policies,
concentration/mixing/robustness certificates,
explicit statement of what is claimed (e.g., “within (\varepsilon) with probability (1-\alpha)”),so that downstream uses can propagate uncertainty correctly and corridors can prevent illicit promotion to deterministic OK.
8.3.2 Calculus
8.3.2.1 Probabilistic existence and uniqueness criteria
Rule 8.48 (Probabilistic existence). A probabilistic existence claim requires a certificate of the form:[\mathbb P\big(\exists x\in S:\ |H(x)|\le \tau\big)\ge 1-\alpha,]with (\tau) and (\alpha) pinned and derived from estimator bounds.
Rule 8.49 (Probabilistic uniqueness). Uniqueness in noisy settings is typically a statement about identifiability cones:[\mathbb P\big(x^\star \in E \ \land\ E\ \text{contains at most one solution modulo symmetry}\big)\ge 1-\alpha,]requiring identifiability certificates or explicit equivalence class semantics.
8.3.2.2 Concentration and tail regime gates for zero certification
Cloud corridors gate which estimators and bounds are admissible based on tail regimes and dependence.
Rule 8.50 (Tail gate). If the corridor requires sub-Gaussian tails to use a concentration inequality, then absent tail certification the claim must be AMBIG or must switch to robust estimators with heavy-tail-compatible certificates.
Rule 8.51 (Dependence gate). If samples come from a Markov process, any concentration bound used must include mixing certificates; otherwise the claim cannot be promoted beyond AMBIG/NEAR.
8.3.2.3 Propagation of uncertainty through zero-forging pipelines
Uncertainty propagates through transformations and solver iterations using pinned propagation algebra.
Rule 8.52 (Uncertainty propagation). For a pipeline producing an enclosure (E), the total error bound is:[\mathrm{Err}{\mathrm{total}} \le \mathrm{Err}{\mathrm{est}} + \mathrm{Err}{\mathrm{disc}} + \mathrm{Err}{\mathrm{iter}} + \mathrm{Err}_{\mathrm{model}},]with each term ledgered and certified. Missing terms force AMBIG.
8.3.2.4 AMBIG semantics: set-valued outcomes and evidence plans
Cloud regimes frequently yield intrinsic ambiguity; the calculus makes ambiguity constructive.
Rule 8.53 (Set-valued constant semantics). When identifiability or branch selection prevents a unique constant value, the object must be represented as:
an equivalence class of candidates (CandidateSet),
or a confidence region enclosure (E),together with an EvidencePlan specifying additional constraints needed to collapse the set. Any downstream claim using such an object must explicitly state whether it is uniform over candidates or conditional on a chosen representative.
8.3.3 Algorithms
8.3.3.1 Stochastic root finding and stochastic approximation
Algorithm 8.54 (StochasticApproximation). Input: noisy evaluations (\widehat H(x;\omega)), step schedule ({\eta_n}), corridor policy. Output: iterate (x_n) and uncertainty ledger.
Form:[x_{n+1}=x_n - \eta_n \widehat H(x_n;\omega_n),]with pinned conditions for convergence (step size schedule, bounded variance, stability). The algorithm emits:
bias/variance estimates,
tail regime diagnostics,
stopping criteria based on confidence bounds.
8.3.3.2 Confidence enclosure construction from sampled residuals
Algorithm 8.55 (BuildConfidenceEnclosure). Input: candidate solution (\hat x), residual estimator (\widehat{\mathrm{Res}}(x)), confidence level (1-\alpha), corridor. Output: enclosure (E) such that (x^\star\in E) with probability (\ge 1-\alpha).
Methods:
invert a confidence bound on residual: (E={x:\widehat{\mathrm{Res}}(x)\le \tau(\alpha)}),
linearize via Jacobian confidence bounds to produce ellipsoidal enclosures,
use bootstrap only if corridor permits and randomness is pinned.
8.3.3.3 Robust zero forging under heavy tails and contamination
Algorithm 8.56 (RobustZeroForge). Input: noisy system, robust estimator family (median-of-means, M-estimators), corridor. Output: stochastic zero object with robust certificates.
Stages:
choose robust estimator compatible with certified tail regime,
compute robust residual estimates and bounds,
compute enclosure and risk records,
output evidence plan if identifiability remains unresolved.
8.3.3.4 Stochastic seed assembly with replay commitments
Algorithm 8.57 (ForgeStochasticSeed). Input: stochastic zero object, corridor. Output: stochastic seed.
Seed includes:
pinned PRNG and seed commitments,
deterministic schedule of random draws,
transcript hashes for all estimations,
confidence semantics and propagation requirements,
explicit statement that the object is probabilistic and cannot be promoted to deterministic OK without additional evidence.
8.3.4 Certificates
8.3.4.1 Concentration and tail certificates for zero estimates
Certify estimator validity:
tail regime classification,
concentration bounds with failure probability (\alpha),
dependence/mixing conditions when required,
compatibility with the chosen estimator.
8.3.4.2 Confidence enclosure correctness certificates
Certify that the constructed enclosure meets the claimed confidence semantics:
explicit definition of enclosure,
proof of coverage probability under pinned assumptions,
replay transcript and randomness pinning.
8.3.4.3 Identifiability and ambiguity certificates for stochastic zeros
Certify either:
identifiability and uniqueness (possibly modulo symmetry) within confidence bounds, or
explicit ambiguity sets and evidence plans for disambiguation.
8.3.4.4 Stochastic replay determinism certificates
Certify that stochastic computations are replayable:
pinned PRNG and stream schedule,
transcript hash stability,
deterministic ordering and rounding environment pinning when necessary.
8.4 Fractal — Multiscale zero-forging, continuation, and seed compression hierarchies
8.4.1 Objects
8.4.1.1 Multiresolution constraint systems and scale ladders
Fractal zero-calculus treats a law/constant as a family of constraints across scales.
Definition 8.58 (Scale ladder for zero systems). A scale ladder is an ordered set (\mathcal E) with presentations:[\mathcal Z_\epsilon := (X_\epsilon,\ H_\epsilon,\ \mathbb V_\epsilon,{0},\mathrm{Dom}\epsilon,\mathrm{Meta}\epsilon),]where (\epsilon) indexes resolution (grid spacing, truncation order, approximation level). The ladder includes restriction/prolongation maps between (X_\epsilon) (Chapter 6.4) and comparison maps between value spaces.
8.4.1.2 Homotopy and continuation objects
Fractal forging uses continuation to connect easy zeros to hard zeros.
Definition 8.59 (Homotopy zero object). A homotopy is a family:[H(x;\lambda),\quad \lambda\in[0,1],]with (H(\cdot;0)) solvable and (H(\cdot;1)) the target. A continuation object includes:
homotopy definition,
path parameterization and step policy,
admissibility domains ensuring no singularities are crossed,
certificates tracking transversality and stability along the path.
8.4.1.3 Fixed-point anchors and Absolute-Zero meta-objects
Fractal seeds rely on fixed points and meta-fixed points to unify families of zeros.
Definition 8.60 (Anchor zero). An anchor is a hardened zero at a coarse scale (\epsilon_0) that seeds continuation/refinement:[x^\star_{\epsilon_0}\in \mathsf Z(H_{\epsilon_0}),]with certificates allowing propagation to finer scales.
Definition 8.61 (Absolute-Zero meta-object). A meta-zero object is a fixed point of the zero-forging/seed-compression pipeline itself: a canonical hub seed from which local zeros can be collapsed and re-expanded through certified transports and scale maps. Its admissible role is to provide a canonical normalization interface for routing between families of zero objects. Any use of this meta-object must be explicit and corridor-governed, and must not replace local certificates; it serves as an organizational hub and does not bypass admissibility.
8.4.1.4 Hierarchical seeds and holographic compression of zero objects
Fractal storage uses hierarchical seeds: coarse seeds compress fine expansions.
Definition 8.62 (Hierarchical seed tower). A hierarchical seed tower is:[{\mathfrak s_{\epsilon_k}}{k=0}^N]with expansion maps (\mathrm{Expand}{k\to k+1}) and compression maps (\mathrm{Compress}{k+1\to k}), satisfying idempotence and compatibility:[\mathrm{Compress}{k+1\to k}\big(\mathrm{Expand}{k\to k+1}(\mathfrak s{\epsilon_k})\big)=\mathfrak s_{\epsilon_k}.]Each level stores:
the zero presentation at that scale,
enclosures and hardness bounds appropriate to scale,
propagation bounds to the next level,
commitments to the minimal witness set.
Hierarchical seeds enable efficient regeneration and bounded drift under refinement.
8.4.2 Calculus
8.4.2.1 Coarse-to-fine existence/uniqueness propagation
Rule 8.63 (Propagation of isolation). If a zero is isolated and hardened at scale (\epsilon) with enclosure (E_\epsilon) and derivative bounds, then under refinement to (\epsilon'\prec \epsilon), there exists a corresponding zero (x^\star_{\epsilon'}) near (x^\star_\epsilon) provided the discretization defect is within the stability radius implied by hardness. This yields a bound:[|x^\star_{\epsilon'}-x^\star_\epsilon|\le \kappa, \Delta_{\mathrm{disc}}(\epsilon,\epsilon') + \cdots]with pinned constants and terms.
Propagation is admissible only if:
RP/PR consistency certificates exist (Chapter 6.4),
defect propagation algebra is complete (Chapter 4.4),
branch and domain admissibility persist across scales.
8.4.2.2 Continuation stability and path admissibility
Rule 8.64 (Continuation admissibility). A continuation path (\lambda\mapsto x(\lambda)) is admissible on ([0,1]) if:
(H(x(\lambda);\lambda)=0) holds under certified tolerance,
transversality/nondegeneracy is maintained (no singular Jacobian) or singular events are explicitly detected and handled by a corridor-permitted bifurcation protocol,
domain and branch guards remain valid along the path.
Any unhandled singular event forces FAIL or AMBIG; it may not be silently ignored.
8.4.2.3 Multiscale budgets and tightening schedules for zero objects
Rule 8.65 (Tightening schedules). As scale refines, enclosures tighten and tolerances shrink:[\varepsilon_{\epsilon_{k+1}} \le \varepsilon_{\epsilon_k},\qquad \mathrm{rad}(E_{\epsilon_{k+1}})\le \mathrm{rad}(E_{\epsilon_k}),]under corridor-pinned schedule. Promotion to OK at finer scales requires:
closure of all propagation obligations,
stability certificates ensuring no drift beyond schedule,
replay determinism across levels.
8.4.2.4 Seed coherence: invariants under expansion/compression and transport
Rule 8.66 (Seed coherence gate). A hierarchical seed tower is coherent iff:
each level satisfies the compression contract,
cross-level propagation bounds are certified,
invariant suites are stable across levels (Chapter 7.4),
transports between presentations preserve the zero object on the declared regions.
Incoherent towers are quarantined; they cannot be used to justify OK results in downstream constructions.
8.4.3 Algorithms
8.4.3.1 Multiscale zero solver: refine, correct, certify
Algorithm 8.67 (MultiscaleZeroForge). Input: scale ladder ({\mathcal Z_{\epsilon_k}}), coarse anchor zero (x^\star_{\epsilon_0}), corridor. Output: refined zero objects and hierarchical seed tower.
Steps:
At scale (\epsilon_0), ensure anchor has existence/uniqueness/hardness certificates.
For (k=0) to (N-1):
prolongate (x^\star_{\epsilon_k}) to initial guess on (\epsilon_{k+1}),
run pinned correction solver (Newton, projected method, or contraction iteration),
compute residual and enclosure at (\epsilon_{k+1}),
verify propagation bounds and update hardness certificates,
record discretization defect and any truncation terms in ledger.
Seal each level into seed (\mathfrak s_{\epsilon_k}) with replay commitments.
If any level fails admissibility or cannot be certified within budget, return AMBIG with evidence plan or FAIL with minimal witness.
8.4.3.2 Homotopy continuation for hard constraint systems
Algorithm 8.68 (CertifiedContinuation). Input: homotopy (H(x;\lambda)), initial solution (x(0)), step policy, corridor. Output: solution at (\lambda=1) with certificates.
Stages:
Predict step: use tangent predictor based on (DH) invertibility (pinned).
Correct step: solve (H(x;\lambda)=0) at new (\lambda) with pinned solver.
Certify transversality and enclosure at each step; adjust step size deterministically based on certified condition numbers.
Detect singularities; if encountered, either follow corridor-permitted bifurcation protocol or return AMBIG/FAIL.
Continuation transcripts are stored and hashed for replay.
8.4.3.3 Hardened-zero propagation and derivative-bound transfer across scales
Algorithm 8.69 (PropagateHardnessAcrossScale). Input: hardened zero at scale (\epsilon_k), discretization maps, corridor. Output: hardness bounds at (\epsilon_{k+1}).
Steps:
Use defect bounds between (H_{\epsilon_k}) and (H_{\epsilon_{k+1}}) to bound changes in Jacobian/derivatives.
Transfer invertibility lower bounds (e.g., (\sigma_{\min})) with perturbation inequalities.
If bounds degrade below corridor thresholds, trigger refinement or change solver mode; otherwise certify hardness at new scale.
8.4.3.4 Seed tower sealing and extraction index generation
Algorithm 8.70 (SealSeedTower). Input: seeds ({\mathfrak s_{\epsilon_k}}), corridor set. Output: sealed module with summary node and extraction indices.
Outputs:
module containing all seed levels and propagation certificates,
summary node encoding anchor invariants and stability signatures,
indices mapping:
scale → enclosure,
scale → derivative bounds,
scale → replay transcript,
transport edges linking scale-level presentations to alternate definition families.
This enables deterministic “zoom” operations: retrieve coarse understanding quickly or expand to fine detail when required.
8.4.4 Certificates
8.4.4.1 Multiscale existence/uniqueness propagation certs
Certify that zeros persist across scales:
existence at each scale,
uniqueness/isolation at each scale,
propagation bounds linking solutions across scales,
admissibility persistence (domains/branches) across scales.
8.4.4.2 Continuation admissibility and transversality certs
Certify continuation path correctness:
stepwise enclosures and transversality bounds,
no singular crossings (or certified handling),
deterministic step schedule and replay commitments,
final solution enclosure at (\lambda=1).
8.4.4.3 Seed tower coherence and tightening schedule certs
Certify:
compression contract at each level,
tightening schedule compliance (enclosures shrink, tolerances tighten),
invariant stability across scales,
budget closure and replay determinism for all levels.
8.4.4.4 Holographic seed integrity certs (module sealing, expansion closure)
Certify that the sealed module:
regenerates all levels by expansion,
preserves all proofs and certificates,
maintains stable references and EdgeIDs under regression policies,
prevents recursive explosion by enforcing budgets and returning AMBIG when exceeded.

Chapter 9 — Spin (\chi), Parity Channels, (±) Decomposition (Addr ⟨0020⟩₄)
9.1 Square — Involutions, (±) projections, and algebraic channel splits
9.1.1 Objects
9.1.1.1 Involution objects and Spin-(\chi) operators
Spin-(\chi) is the primitive operation that generates parity channels by a certified involution acting on carriers, operators, and presentations.
Definition 9.1 (Involution). An involution on a carrier (X) is a map[\chi_X:X\to X]such that (\chi_X\circ \chi_X = \mathrm{id}X) on a declared admissible domain (\mathrm{Dom}\chi\subseteq X). The involution is typed and may be:
linear (e.g., (x\mapsto -x)),
conjugate-linear (e.g., complex conjugation),
coordinate reversal (e.g., time reversal),
index reversal (e.g., sequence reversal),
dualization operator (when (\chi) is defined on a category of objects).
Definition 9.2 (Spin-(\chi) object). A Spin-(\chi) object is:[\chi := (\chi_X,\ \chi_{\mathbb V},\ \chi_{\mathrm{Op}},\ \mathrm{Dom}\chi,\ \mathrm{Branch}\chi,\ \mathrm{Meta}_\chi),]where:
(\chi_X) is the involution on the carrier,
(\chi_{\mathbb V}) is the induced involution on value spaces,
(\chi_{\mathrm{Op}}) is the induced action on operators or presentations,
(\mathrm{Branch}_\chi) pins branch behavior if (\chi) involves multivalued primitives (e.g., (\arg), (\log)),
(\mathrm{Meta}_\chi) pins admissibility conditions and required certificates.
Invariant 9.3 (Involution admissibility). A Spin-(\chi) object is admissible for a presentation (\mathcal P=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0,\mathrm{Dom})) on region (S) only if:
(S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}\cap \mathrm{Dom}_\chi),
(\chi_X(S)\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}),
branch conventions are compatible on (S\cup \chi_X(S)),
(\chi_{\mathbb V}(\mathbb V_0)=\mathbb V_0) when parity is meant to preserve feasibility semantics.
9.1.1.2 Parity channel objects (A,B) and parity labels
The involution induces a canonical splitting into “(A)” (original) and “(B)” (flipped) channels and defines parity labels.
Definition 9.4 (A/B channel lift). Given an object (X) (state, operator, presentation), define its (A)-channel as (X^A:=X), and its (B)-channel as the (\chi)-image:[X^B := \chi(X^A).]For a state (x\in X), define (x^B := \chi_X(x)). For an operator (f), define (f^B := \chi_{\mathrm{Op}}(f)). For a presentation (\mathcal P), define (\mathcal P^B := \chi_{\mathrm{Op}}(\mathcal P)) (explicitly defined below).
Definition 9.5 (Parity labels). Parity labels are attached to objects as metadata:
even ((+)) if (\chi(X)=X) (fixed under (\chi)),
odd ((-)) if (\chi(X)=-X) in a linear setting or if the invariant gate is anti-fixed under (\chi),
mixed if neither condition holds but a (±) decomposition exists.
Parity labels are not informal: they determine which components may be safely treated as invariants (even) and which are treated as oriented or signed content (odd).
9.1.1.3 (±) projectors and decomposition objects
The involution yields canonical projectors onto even/odd subspaces.
Definition 9.6 ((±) projectors). Let (\chi) act linearly on a vector space (W). Define:[P_+ := \frac{1}{2}(I+\chi),\qquad P_- := \frac{1}{2}(I-\chi).]Then:
(P_+^2=P_+), (P_-^2=P_-),
(P_+P_-=0),
(P_++P_-=I),
(W = W_+\oplus W_-) where (W_\pm:=\mathrm{Im}(P_\pm)).
Definition 9.7 (Even/odd components). For any (w\in W),[w^+ := P_+(w)=\frac{w+\chi(w)}{2},\qquad w^- := P_-(w)=\frac{w-\chi(w)}{2}.]These satisfy (\chi(w^+)=w^+), (\chi(w^-)=-w^-).
Definition 9.8 (Decomposition object). A decomposition object records:[\mathcal D_\chi := (W,\chi,P_+,P_-,\mathrm{NF},\mathrm{Admissibility},\mathrm{Certs}),]where NF pins the canonical form of the decomposition in the manuscript and Certs include idempotence checks and domain compatibility.
In non-linear settings, parity channels are defined at the level of observables and defects rather than linear decomposition; the corridor must pin what “even” and “odd” mean in that context.
9.1.1.4 Gauge vs physical content separation objects
Parity channels formalize the separation between gauge content (representation-dependent) and physical/invariant content (representation-independent).
Definition 9.9 (Gauge component). A component (G) of an object is gauge relative to (\chi) if it is odd or changes under (\chi) without altering corridor-defined invariants. Operationally, gauge components are those that can be altered by allowed (\chi)-symmetry actions without changing satisfaction or invariant suite values.
Definition 9.10 (Physical component). A component (P) is physical relative to (\chi) if it lies in the even channel and is invariant under all admissible (\chi)-actions required by corridor. Physical components are used as gates for equivalence and are permitted in canonical seeds.
Definition 9.11 (Gauge-fixing object). A gauge-fixing object for (\chi) is a rule (F) that selects a canonical representative in each (\chi)-orbit:[F: X/\langle\chi\rangle \to X,]on a declared domain, together with invertibility and holonomy certificates as required (see Chapter 4.2 and Chapter 5.2). Gauge-fixing resolves ambiguity when the odd channel carries no physical meaning but influences representation.
9.1.2 Calculus
9.1.2.1 Induced action of (\chi) on operators and presentations
Spin-(\chi) must act consistently on states, operators, and satisfaction semantics.
Definition 9.12 (Operator action). Let (f:X\to X) be an operator on carrier (X). The (\chi)-transformed operator is:[\chi_{\mathrm{Op}}(f) := \chi_X \circ f \circ \chi_X,]on the admissible domain where composition is defined. This is a conjugacy action by (\chi_X), and is compatible with the rotation calculus (Chapter 3).
Definition 9.13 (Presentation action). Let (\mathcal P=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0,\mathrm{Dom})). Define:[\mathcal P^B := \chi(\mathcal P) := (X,\ \Phi^B,\ \mathbb V,\ \mathbb V_0,\ \mathrm{Dom}^B),]where:
(\mathrm{Dom}^B := \chi_X^{-1}(\mathrm{Dom})\cap \mathrm{Dom}_\chi),
(\Phi^B(x) := \chi_{\mathbb V}\big(\Phi(\chi_X(x))\big)),with branch and domain guards transported accordingly.
Proposition 9.14 (Satisfaction transport under (\chi)). If (\chi_{\mathbb V}(\mathbb V_0)=\mathbb V_0) and (x\in \mathrm{Dom}^B), then:[x \models \mathcal P^B \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \chi_X(x)\models \mathcal P.]Thus (\chi) preserves feasibility semantics when its target set is stable.
9.1.2.2 Even/odd decomposition of constraints and residuals
Parity decomposition can be applied to evaluation maps and residuals to separate invariant constraints from oriented constraints.
Definition 9.15 (Parity-split constraint). For an evaluation map (\Phi) taking values in a vector space (\mathbb V) on which (\chi_{\mathbb V}) acts linearly, define:[\Phi^+ := P_+\Phi,\qquad \Phi^- := P_-\Phi,]so (\Phi = \Phi^+ + \Phi^-).
Rule 9.16 (Parity gating for equivalence). Under corridors that treat (\chi) as a gauge symmetry:
equivalence gates are enforced primarily on (\Phi^+) and its induced invariants,
(\Phi^-) is treated as gauge content, and must either be eliminated by gauge-fixing or recorded as an ambiguity class.
Under corridors that treat (\chi) as a physical symmetry (e.g., time reversal with physical consequences), (\Phi^-) may be required to match up to sign, or to satisfy a pinned anti-invariance criterion.
Definition 9.17 (Residual parity). If residual is defined by a norm (|\Phi(x)|) and the norm is (\chi)-invariant, then the residual is even:[\mathrm{Res}(x)=\mathrm{Res}(\chi_X(x)),]subject to admissibility. This provides a canonical mechanism by which residual-based NEAR claims can remain stable under parity.
9.1.2.3 Parity as a factorization tool for rotation routes
Parity decomposition reduces the complexity of rotation routes by splitting the space into channels with distinct coherence obligations.
Rule 9.18 (Channelwise transport). For an admissible rotation chain, transport and defect evaluation may be performed channelwise:[f^{(T)} \Rightarrow (f^{(T)})^+,\ (f^{(T)})^-,]and equivalence defects can be decomposed:[\Delta = \max(\Delta_+,\Delta_-)]or by a corridor-pinned aggregator. Corridors may impose:
strict bounds on (\Delta_+) (physical content),
relaxed bounds or gauge-fixing requirements for (\Delta_-).
Rule 9.19 (Parity-aided canonicalization). Two transport routes that differ only by a (\chi)-gauge action are equivalent for physical claims if:
their even-channel transports commute (diagram defect within tolerance),
their odd-channel mismatch is removable by an admissible gauge-fix or is declared irrelevant by corridor policy.
This rule is enforced via explicit EQUIV edges and diagram witnesses (Chapter 5).
9.1.2.4 Defects under flips: commutators, holonomy, and parity leakage
Parity introduces defect classes measuring failure of expected symmetry under (\chi).
Definition 9.20 (Parity defect for an observable). For an observable (I), define:[\Delta_\chi(I;S) := \sup_{x\in S} d\big(I(\chi_X(x)),\ \chi_{\mathcal Y}(I(x))\big),]where (\chi_{\mathcal Y}) is the induced action on the observable’s codomain. Evenness corresponds to (\Delta_\chi=0) with (\chi_{\mathcal Y}=\mathrm{id}); oddness corresponds to (\Delta_\chi=0) with (\chi_{\mathcal Y}=-\mathrm{id}) in linear settings.
Definition 9.21 (Parity leakage in dynamics). For a propagator (U_t), parity commutation defect is:[\Delta_{\mathrm{comm}}^\chi(t;S) := \sup_{x\in S} d\big(\chi_X(U_t x),\ U_t(\chi_X x)\big).]Nonzero commutation defect indicates parity-breaking dynamics or numerical leakage; corridors decide whether this is physical (must be measured) or illegal (FAIL for coherence corridors).
Definition 9.22 (Parity holonomy). If gauge-fixing conventions are used to select representatives in (\chi)-orbits, holonomy around loops is detected by composing parity operations and route transports and measuring drift in the chosen gauge. Nonzero holonomy indicates inconsistent gauge conventions and is quarantined when it affects physical invariants.
9.1.3 Algorithms
9.1.3.1 Construct and validate Spin-(\chi) objects
Algorithm 9.23 (BuildSpinChi). Input: carrier (X), intended involution definition, corridor policy. Output: Spin-(\chi) object (\chi) with admissibility obligations.
Steps:
Define (\chi_X) and specify (\mathrm{Dom}_\chi) with explicit guards.
Define induced actions (\chi_{\mathbb V}) on all relevant value spaces.
Define (\chi_{\mathrm{Op}}) for operators/presentations in RNF.
Validate involution property on (\mathrm{Dom}_\chi) (exact or within pinned tolerance if permitted).
Emit obligations for branch coherence and domain invariance where required.
Pseudocode:
function BuildSpinChi(definition, Carrier, Policy):
chiX = define_involution(definition, Carrier)
Dom = define_domain_guards(definition, Carrier)
if not verify_involution(chiX, Dom, Policy): return FAIL/AMBIG
chiV = induce_value_actions(chiX, Policy)
chiOp = induce_operator_action(chiX, chiV, Policy)
return SpinChi(chiX, chiV, chiOp, Dom, BranchPolicy, Meta)
9.1.3.2 Compute (±) components and channel signatures
Algorithm 9.24 (ParityDecompose). Input: object (w) in a linear (\chi)-space (W), Spin-(\chi), corridor. Output: (w^+,w^-) and a decomposition signature.
Steps:
Verify (\chi) acts linearly on the object’s codomain and that domain is admissible.
Compute (w^+=\tfrac12(w+\chi(w))), (w^-=\tfrac12(w-\chi(w))).
Record norms (|w^+|), (|w^-|) and parity leakage diagnostics (|\chi(w^+)-w^+|), (|\chi(w^-)+w^-|).
Seal the result as an artifact referenced by residual ledgers and invariant suites.
When the object is non-linear (e.g., constraints with branch structure), the algorithm produces an AMBIG outcome unless a corridor pins a linearization regime and provides stability certificates.
9.1.3.3 Gauge-fix and normalize odd-channel ambiguity
Algorithm 9.25 (GaugeFixChi). Input: state or representation (x), Spin-(\chi), gauge-fixing rule (F), corridor. Output: canonical representative (x_{\mathrm{gf}}) and gauge certificates.
Steps:
Verify admissibility of (F) on the orbit of (x).
Compute representative (x_{\mathrm{gf}}=F([x])).
Verify stability and invertibility conditions of the gauge-fix (local uniqueness on region) or return AMBIG with candidate representatives.
Record gauge-fix map and phase/frame conventions as part of a gauge object for later holonomy audits.
Gauge-fixing is required whenever odd-channel variation is treated as non-physical but affects representation-dependent computations.
9.1.3.4 Parity-aware defect evaluation in equivalence checking
Algorithm 9.26 (ParityAwareEquivalenceDefect). Input: candidate equivalence route (A\to B), invariant suite (\mathfrak I), Spin-(\chi), corridor. Output: channelwise defect ledger ((\Delta_+,\Delta_-)) and verdict guidance.
Steps:
Compute parity decomposition of relevant invariants or evaluation maps for (A) and (B).
Evaluate even-channel gate: require (\Delta_+\le \varepsilon_+) for corridor’s physical tolerance.
Evaluate odd-channel behavior:
if corridor treats odd as gauge: verify it is removable by gauge-fix or irrelevant; otherwise require (\Delta_-) within gauge tolerance.
if corridor treats odd as physical: require the correct anti-invariance criterion or bounded mismatch.
Emit:
PASS if both channel requirements are met,
FAIL if even-channel mismatch exceeds threshold by certified bound,
AMBIG if channel decomposition cannot be certified or gauge-fix is non-unique, with an evidence plan.

9.2 Flower — Conjugation symmetries, anti-unitary structure, and coherence under (\chi)
9.2.1 Objects
9.2.1.1 Conjugation objects on complex and operator spaces
In coherent systems, the dominant involution is conjugation.
Definition 9.27 (Complex conjugation). On (\mathbb C), define (\chi(z)=\overline z). On (\mathbb C^n), (\chi) acts componentwise. Conjugation is an involution and is conjugate-linear.
Definition 9.28 (Adjoint and anti-unitary). On a Hilbert space (X), define the adjoint (A^\ast). An anti-unitary operator (K) satisfies:[\langle Kx,Ky\rangle = \overline{\langle x,y\rangle}.]Time-reversal symmetries are modeled as anti-unitary involutions (K) in many coherent regimes. These are Flower-layer parity objects because they preserve norms while flipping complex phases.
Definition 9.29 (Operator conjugation action). For an operator (H) with matrix representation, conjugation induces:[H \mapsto \overline{H},\quad \text{and}\quad H \mapsto KHK^{-1}]for anti-unitary (K), with domain restrictions.
These objects support parity channels on spectra, phases, and conserved quantities.
9.2.1.2 Symmetry-coherent invariants under (\chi)
Symmetry invariants under (\chi) include:
spectral invariants stable under conjugation (eigenvalues conjugate),
real-valued conserved charges (even under conjugation),
orientation-dependent invariants (odd under time reversal).
These invariants are stored as Flower invariant suites (Chapter 7.2) with explicit (\chi)-actions and gates.
9.2.1.3 Duality objects coupling (\chi) to rotation routes
Parity and rotation interact: (\chi) may commute or anti-commute with transforms.
Definition 9.30 (Parity-rotation coherence object). A coherence object is:[\mathcal C_{\chi,T}:=(\chi,\ T,\ \Delta_{\chi,T},\ \mathrm{Region},\ \mathrm{Witness},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]where[\Delta_{\chi,T}(S):=\sup_{x\in S} d\big(\chi(T(x)),\ T(\chi(x))\big)]measures whether (\chi) commutes with (T) on region (S). This is a commuting-square defect specialized to parity.
9.2.1.4 Coherence auditing objects (false parity, false unitarity)
Flower audits include detecting:
false parity: claimed even/odd classification fails under certified bounds,
false unitarity under basis swaps combined with conjugation,
hidden branch cut crossings that invalidate conjugation invariants (e.g., (\arg) discontinuities).
These audits produce holonomy records and conflict packets (Chapter 5) when inconsistencies are detected.
9.2.2 Calculus
9.2.2.1 Anti-unitary symmetry constraints and induced parity rules
Anti-unitary symmetries impose precise transformation rules on observables.
Rule 9.31 (Spectral conjugation under anti-unitary symmetry). If (KHK^{-1}=H) for anti-unitary (K), then spectral data exhibits conjugation symmetry; in particular, eigenvalues occur in complex conjugate pairs, and for self-adjoint (H) the spectrum is real.
Rule 9.32 (Parity commutation as a diagram obligation). Any equivalence route that uses parity operations must include commuting-square obligations ensuring:[\chi\circ T \approx T\circ \chi]on the declared region. Failure is either:
physical parity-breaking (must be measured and recorded), or
illegal drift (FAIL) when corridor requires symmetry preservation.
9.2.2.2 Coherence defects under (\chi): leakage bounds and invariance gates
Coherence defects under (\chi) are treated as parity leakage and must be bounded.
Rule 9.33 (Parity leakage). For a propagator (U_t), parity leakage is:[\Delta^\chi_{\mathrm{comm}}(t;S) = \sup_{x\in S} d(\chi(U_t x),U_t\chi(x)).]Corridors prescribe whether (\Delta^\chi_{\mathrm{comm}}) must vanish (OK), be bounded (NEAR), or be treated as an intrinsic phenomenon (recorded as a physical effect).
9.2.2.3 Gauge vs physical separation via invariant suites
Flower-layer parity is used to separate:
gauge-dependent phases and frames (odd channel),
physical invariants (even channel).
Rule 9.34 (Even-channel primacy). In corridors that treat (\chi) as gauge symmetry, equivalence requires equality of all even-channel invariants and allows odd-channel mismatch only when a gauge-fix exists and is certified.
9.2.2.4 Normal forms for parity-coherent representations
Representations are normalized to stabilize parity classification.
Rule 9.35 (Parity normal form). A parity-coherent normal form includes:
explicit (\chi) declaration,
explicit parity labels for key observables,
explicit gauge-fixing conventions,
explicit branch conventions for discontinuous observables,so that parity comparisons across modules are deterministic and auditable.
9.2.3 Algorithms
9.2.3.1 Parity-rotation commutation checker
Algorithm 9.36 (CheckChiCommutesWithTransform). Input: (\chi), transform (T), region (S), metric (d), corridor. Output: commutation defect (\Delta_{\chi,T}(S)) and verdict guidance.
Steps:
Verify admissibility of (\chi) and (T) on (S).
Compute both compositions (\chi(T(x))) and (T(\chi(x))) on pinned test regime in (S).
Bound the difference with analytic bounds or replay tests.
Emit certificate or obligation depending on corridor.
9.2.3.2 Spectral parity diagnostics under conjugation
Algorithm 9.37 (SpectralConjugationCheck). Input: operator (H), conjugation symmetry object, corridor. Output: spectral parity signature.
Steps:
Compute or bound spectrum under pinned method.
Check conjugate-pair structure within tolerances.
Emit spectral invariance certificate or conflict packet if violated under strict corridor.
9.2.3.3 Gauge normalization for phases/frames in coherent systems
Algorithm 9.38 (PhaseFrameNormalize). Input: eigenbasis or frame field, parity/gauge conventions, corridor. Output: normalized basis and holonomy diagnostics.
Steps:
Apply deterministic gauge-fix rules to select phase/frame.
Evaluate holonomy around pinned loops in parameter space.
Quarantine if holonomy exceeds thresholds for corridors requiring coherent global gauge.
9.2.3.4 Parity-aware route selection
Algorithm 9.39 (ParityAwareRouteSelect). Input: candidate equivalence routes, parity commutation costs, invariant gates. Output: canonical route.
Selection:
prefer routes with certified (\chi)-commutation (minimal (\Delta_{\chi,T})),
prefer routes with minimal odd-channel ambiguity,
tie-break deterministically as in kernel routing policies (Chapter 5).
9.2.4 Certificates
9.2.4.1 Anti-unitary/Conjugation symmetry certs
Certify that conjugation or anti-unitary symmetry holds on the declared domain:
operator equality (KHK^{-1}=H) (exact or bounded),
admissibility and domain closure,
spectral consequences and their verification regime.
9.2.4.2 Parity-rotation commutation certs
Certify that (\chi) commutes (or anti-commutes, when pinned) with the transforms used in equivalence routes, with defect bounds within corridor thresholds.
9.2.4.3 Gauge coherence and holonomy certs under (\chi)
Certify that gauge-fixing conventions yield consistent representatives:
uniqueness and stability of gauge fix,
bounded holonomy in parity-sensitive parameter loops,
quarantine triggers and enforcement.
9.2.4.4 Parity-coherent equivalence certs
Certify that equivalence edges respect parity semantics:
even-channel invariants match,
odd-channel mismatch is resolved by certified gauge-fix or satisfies anti-invariance criteria,
commutation diagrams involving (\chi) close within thresholds,
all evidence is replayable and corridor budgets close.
9.3 Cloud — Parity in probability: symmetric channels, couplings, and sign-invariant observables
9.3.1 Objects
9.3.1.1 Involutive symmetries on distributions
Cloud parity acts on measures via pushforward under (\chi).
Definition 9.40 (Pushforward under (\chi)). For measure (\mu) on (X),[\chi_#\mu(A) := \mu(\chi_X^{-1}(A)).]A distribution is (\chi)-symmetric if (\chi_#\mu=\mu).
9.3.1.2 Even/odd observables in stochastic systems
An observable (f:X\to\mathbb R) is even if (f(\chi(x))=f(x)) and odd if (f(\chi(x))=-f(x)). Even observables are insensitive to parity flips and are natural physical content in parity-gauge corridors. Odd observables capture oriented information and require explicit handling.
9.3.1.3 Coupling objects for parity comparisons
Definition 9.41 (Parity coupling). A coupling between (\mu) and (\chi_#\mu) is a joint distribution (\gamma) on (X\times X) with marginals (\mu) and (\chi_#\mu). Coupling objects enable certified bounds on parity defects in distribution metrics (TV, Wasserstein), and support parity invariance certification.
9.3.1.4 Parity-aware uncertainty ledgers
Parity affects identifiability and estimator variance when data is symmetric under flips. Ledgers must record whether data provides information only about even-channel parameters and whether odd-channel parameters remain unidentifiable (forcing set-valued outcomes).
9.3.2 Calculus
9.3.2.1 Data processing under parity folding
Parity folding maps (x\mapsto [x]={x,\chi(x)}), which is a non-invertible compression. Data processing implies loss of odd-channel information. Any inference that claims recovery of odd-channel parameters from parity-folded data is FAIL unless additional asymmetry observables are introduced and certified.
9.3.2.2 Symmetry constraints and stationary distributions under (\chi)
For Markov kernels (K), (\chi)-symmetry can be expressed as:[K(\chi(x),\chi(A)) = K(x,A),]which implies stationary distributions inherit parity symmetry. Deviations are measured by parity defects and govern corridor truth.
9.3.2.3 Identifiability boundaries induced by parity
Parity invariance induces aliasing: parameters differing by (\chi) may produce identical observables. Corridors require explicit identifiability certificates or set-valued semantics for such parameters.
9.3.2.4 Composition of parity defects through pipelines
Parity defects propagate through kernels and transforms with Lipschitz constants and coupling-based inequalities; all terms must be ledgered and certified, else AMBIG.
9.3.3 Algorithms
9.3.3.1 Parity symmetry tests for empirical distributions
Compute empirical parity defect:
compare statistics of (f(x)) and (f(\chi(x))),
perform two-sample tests under pinned randomness and multiple-testing correction policies,
output confidence bounds and evidence plans when tests are inconclusive.
9.3.3.2 Parity coupling construction and defect bounds
Construct couplings (e.g., optimal transport coupling for Wasserstein) to bound (W_p(\mu,\chi_#\mu)), producing certificates for parity symmetry or for parity breaking.
9.3.3.3 Parity-aware estimator design
Design estimators that target even-channel parameters when parity symmetry is present, and explicitly return ambiguity classes for odd-channel parameters unless asymmetry evidence is provided.
9.3.3.4 Ledger automation for parity-induced ambiguity
Automatically generate obligations and evidence plans when parity symmetry prevents identifiability:
require asymmetry observables,
require additional measurements,
or rephrase the claim to an equivalence-class statement.
9.3.4 Certificates
9.3.4.1 Distributional parity symmetry certs
Certify (\chi_#\mu=\mu) (exact or bounded in a pinned metric), with replayable computation of defect and confidence.
9.3.4.2 Coupling-based parity defect certs
Certify bounds on (d(\mu,\chi_#\mu)) via couplings, including admissibility conditions and computational transcripts.
9.3.4.3 Identifiability-under-parity certs
Certify which parameters are identifiable given parity symmetry and which are alias classes; provide set-valued semantics or evidence plans.
9.3.4.4 Parity-aware inference safety certs
Certify that downstream inferences do not illegally treat odd-channel quantities as known when parity symmetry implies ambiguity; enforce corridor downgrades where necessary.
9.4 Fractal — Parity across scales: multiresolution flips, twist defects, and channel stability
9.4.1 Objects
9.4.1.1 Scale-indexed involutions and hierarchical parity operators
At multiple scales (\epsilon), parity operators (\chi_\epsilon) may differ or may be induced by coarse-graining.
Definition 9.42 (Scale-indexed parity). A parity ladder is ({\chi_\epsilon:X_\epsilon\to X_\epsilon}) with consistency maps:[R_{\epsilon\to\epsilon'}\circ \chi_\epsilon \approx \chi_{\epsilon'}\circ R_{\epsilon\to\epsilon'}]and analogous relations for prolongation (P).
9.4.1.2 Parity-stable invariant suites across scales
Parity-stable suites require:
even-channel invariants stable across refinement,
odd-channel ambiguity controlled or gauge-fixed consistently,
twist defects between parity and coarse-graining bounded.
9.4.1.3 Twist objects: noncommutation of parity and coarse-grain/rotation
Definition 9.43 (Parity-scale twist defect). Define:[\Delta_{\mathrm{twist}}^\chi := \sup_{x\in S} d\big(R(\chi(x)),\ \chi'(R(x))\big),]measuring noncommutation between parity and coarse-graining. Nonzero twist indicates parity symmetry is scale-dependent; this is treated as a structural feature or a failure depending on corridor.
9.4.1.4 Seed compression objects for parity channels
Parity channels are stored as seeds:
(\chi) definitions and admissibility,
projector definitions and verified properties,
gauge-fixing conventions,
holonomy reports for parity loops,so that parity semantics remain stable under expansion and across modules.
9.4.2 Calculus
9.4.2.1 Coarse-grain parity consistency conditions
Parity may be required to commute with coarse-graining under strict multiscale corridors:[R\circ\chi = \chi'\circ R](or bounded by tolerance). Failure forces either:
representing parity as scale-dependent (distinct (\chi_\epsilon)), or
restricting claims to scales where commutation holds.
9.4.2.2 Universality classes and parity-channel invariants
Universality equivalence under Fractal corridors must specify:
whether parity is part of the universality class (even-channel invariants shared),
whether odd-channel content is irrelevant and thus compressed,
contraction certificates justifying irrelevance of odd-channel variations.
9.4.2.3 Stability of parity decomposition under refinement
Parity decomposition must remain stable:
(w_\epsilon^+) converges to (w^+),
odd-channel norms do not leak into even-channel beyond budgets,
gauge-fixing remains coherent across scales (bounded holonomy).
9.4.2.4 Failure modes: parity leakage, false gauge, and scale twist
Failure modes include:
parity leakage growing under refinement,
gauge-fix holonomy divergence,
twist defect preventing consistent parity across scales.These trigger quarantine and block OK promotion under strict corridors.
9.4.3 Algorithms
9.4.3.1 Compute parity ladders and commutation diagnostics
Construct (\chi_\epsilon) at each scale and compute commutation defects with restriction/prolongation; emit twist records and obligations when bounds are missing.
9.4.3.2 Multiscale parity decomposition and channel tracking
Compute (±) components at each scale; track drift and leakage across scales; integrate into Fractal invariant suites.
9.4.3.3 Parity-aware multiscale route selection
Select equivalence routes minimizing parity twist and holonomy, prioritizing parity-coherent transports when parity is part of the claim’s invariants.
9.4.3.4 Seed tower assembly for parity semantics
Seal parity semantics into hierarchical seeds that can regenerate parity operators, projectors, gauge fixes, and their certificates at each scale.
9.4.4 Certificates
9.4.4.1 Scale-parity commutation certs
Certify bounds on (\Delta_{\mathrm{twist}}^\chi) and establish the scales where parity is consistent with coarse-graining.
9.4.4.2 Channel stability and leakage-boundedness certs
Certify that even/odd decomposition remains stable under refinement and that leakage remains within budgets.
9.4.4.3 Gauge coherence and holonomy certs across scales
Certify that gauge-fixing conventions remain coherent across scales and that parity holonomy is bounded under pinned loop families.
9.4.4.4 Parity-seed integrity certs
Certify compression contracts for parity seeds and that expansion reproduces parity semantics, certificates, and replay transcripts without drift.
CHAPTER 9 — SPIN (\chi), PARITY CHANNELS, (±) DECOMPOSITION (Addr ⟨0020⟩₄)
Chapter 10 — The 256-Operation Crystal ISA + 64 No-Go Lattice (Addr ⟨0021⟩₄)
10.1 Square — ISA enumeration, typing, and executable operation objects
10.1.1 Objects
10.1.1.1 The 256-operation instruction set architecture (ISA) object
The Crystal ISA is a finite, typed operation set that enumerates the permissible primitive “moves” of the framework. Each instruction is an addressable atom with a canonical signature, admissibility conditions, and certificate obligations.
Definition 10.1 (Crystal axes). The ISA is indexed by four 4-valued axes:
Constant axis (\mathcal C={\pi,e,i,\varphi}).
Lens axis (\mathcal L={\mathrm{Square},\mathrm{Flower},\mathrm{Cloud},\mathrm{Fractal}}).
Element axis (\mathcal E={\mathrm{Earth},\mathrm{Water},\mathrm{Fire},\mathrm{Air}}).
Level axis (\mathcal K={L0,L1,L2,L3}).
An instruction address is the 4-tuple:[\mathrm{OpAddr}:=(c,\ell,e,k)\in \mathcal C\times\mathcal L\times\mathcal E\times\mathcal K,]yielding (4^4=256) instructions.
Definition 10.2 (Operation object). An operation object is:[\mathrm{Op}:=(\mathrm{OpAddr},\ \mathrm{Sig},\ \mathrm{InType},\ \mathrm{OutType},\ \mathrm{Dom},\ \mathrm{Effect},\ \mathrm{Invariants},\ \mathrm{Defects},\ \mathrm{NoGoSpec},\ \mathrm{WitnessReq},\ \mathrm{ReplayReq},\ \mathrm{Meta}).]Fields:
Sig: canonical name and description in normal form.
InType/OutType: typed carrier/value schemas (Chapter 2).
Dom: admissibility guards and branch declarations (Chapter 2 and 3).
Effect: a typed operator/presentation transform, possibly parameterized.
Invariants: invariant suite references (Chapter 7).
Defects: defect metrics required to bound correctness (Chapters 3–4).
NoGoSpec: the failure modes this instruction must detect/avoid.
WitnessReq/ReplayReq: required certificate and replay obligations (Chapters 4–5).
Invariant 10.3 (ISA closure). Any primitive move used by the framework must be expressible as a composition of ISA operations with explicit transports and certificates. Any move not representable within the ISA is illegal unless introduced as a new instruction with explicit OpAddr allocation and updated corridor policies.
10.1.1.2 Constant axis semantics: (\pi,e,i,\varphi) as generator tokens
The constant axis provides four generator tokens. Each token functions as a seed gate (Chapter 8) that selects a family of admissible transforms and canonical normal forms.
Definition 10.4 (Constant token semantics). A constant token (c\in\mathcal C) contributes:
a canonical seed object (\mathfrak s_c) (seed forging, Chapter 8),
a definition family (\mathcal F(c)) of equivalent presentations (Chapter 8.2),
a transform vocabulary typical to its semantic domain (e.g., phase/rotation transforms for (\pi), exponential/log transforms for (e), conjugation/parity transforms for (i), self-similar ratio and recursion transforms for (\varphi)),
a pinned set of invariants used as gates (spectral/phase for (\pi), growth/functional for (e), conjugacy/parity for (i), recursion/scale for (\varphi)).
The constant token is not a number; it is a typed generator for allowed operations, admissibility guards, and canonical normal forms.
10.1.1.3 Level semantics (L0)–(L3): abstraction tiers and obligation profiles
Levels encode how an instruction behaves as a semantic move: from identity assertions to algorithmic compilation and certification.
Definition 10.5 (Level tiering).
L0 (Identity/Definition tier). Establishes a definitional identity, type declaration, or canonical normal form. No numerical approximation is permitted unless explicitly encoded as an inequality identity with pinned bounds.
L1 (Transform/Transport tier). Performs a certified representation change (conjugacy, pushforward, gauge fix, basis swap) subject to domain/branch admissibility and required invariant gates.
L2 (Algorithm/Construction tier). Compiles an algorithmic procedure: solver step, estimator, route builder, multiscale step, proof-compression operation. Requires deterministic replay obligations and residual ledgers.
L3 (Certification/Sealing tier). Produces closure artifacts: certificates, minimal witness sets, module seals, regression proofs. L3 operations change the graph state by adding proof-carrying edges (Chapter 5) and updating corridor truth (Chapter 4).
Definition 10.6 (Obligation profiles by level). Each level carries mandatory witness requirements:
L0: requires type correctness and definitional closure obligations (REF edges).
L1: requires admissibility proofs (domain/branch), invariant gate checks, and bounded defects.
L2: requires deterministic algorithm transcripts, stability checks, and uncertainty ledgers.
L3: requires closure proofs, replay determinism certs, and sealed artifacts with content hashes.
10.1.1.4 Element axis semantics: control modes and failure exposure
The element axis is a control mode that specifies which operational principle the instruction prioritizes and which failure patterns must be guarded.
Definition 10.7 (Element modes).
Earth: constraint integrity, discrete structure, admissibility, and boundedness. Earth prioritizes domain guards, lattice preservation, and kernel structure.
Water: coherence, continuity, limit behavior, and branch safety. Water prioritizes avoiding singularity crossing and ensuring proper limit/continuation semantics.
Fire: growth/energy, blow-up control, computational pressure, and resonance. Fire prioritizes controlling unbounded amplification and instability.
Air: representation, recursion, and abstraction consistency. Air prioritizes correct transport of meaning across charts, parity splits, and multiscale coherence.
Element modes determine:
which invariants are primary gates,
which defect metrics are primary,
which no-go patterns the compiler must detect at compile time.
10.1.2 Calculus
10.1.2.1 Typing and compositionality of ISA operations
Operations compose only when types and domains match.
Rule 10.8 (Typed composition). For operations (\mathrm{Op}_1) and (\mathrm{Op}_2) with:[\mathrm{OutType}(\mathrm{Op}_1) = \mathrm{InType}(\mathrm{Op}_2),]their composition is admissible only on:[\mathrm{Dom}(\mathrm{Op}_2\circ \mathrm{Op}_1) := {x\in \mathrm{Dom}(\mathrm{Op}_1):\ \mathrm{Op}_1(x)\in \mathrm{Dom}(\mathrm{Op}_2)},]with all domain and branch guards propagated as in Chapter 3.
If either operation is L3 (sealing), composition must additionally respect MyceliumGraph immutability: new edges are added but prior edges are not mutated.
10.1.2.2 Level-lift and level-lower rules
Operations may be lifted to higher levels by attaching additional obligations; they may be lowered only by explicit weakening of claims and corridor restrictions.
Rule 10.9 (L0→L1 lift). A definitional identity becomes a transport operation by:
introducing an explicit transform object (T),
providing admissibility guards,
specifying invariants preserved under (T),
defining defect metrics and tolerances.
Rule 10.10 (L1→L2 lift). A transport becomes algorithmic by:
compiling an executable procedure implementing the transport,
attaching deterministic replay scripts,
attaching stability diagnostics and uncertainty ledgers.
Rule 10.11 (L2→L3 lift). An algorithmic step becomes sealable by:
generating certificates and minimal witness sets,
closing obligations under corridor truth,
emitting LinkEdges with WitnessPtr/ReplayPtr commitments.
Rule 10.12 (Lowering). Lowering a level is only allowed by weakening semantics:
replacing equality by bounded inequality,
replacing unique outputs by CandidateSets,
replacing exact invariants by toleranced invariants,and must be explicit in the operation’s Effect and in corridor truth payloads.
10.1.2.3 Element-gated admissibility and invariant priority order
Element mode controls which gates are mandatory.
Rule 10.13 (Element priority gates).
Earth: domain admissibility, lattice/kernel invariants, structural closure.
Water: branch coherence, proper limit/continuation certificates, singularity exclusion.
Fire: growth bounds, stability regions, resonance/alias control, blow-up prevention.
Air: commutation/diagram closure, parity consistency, multiscale twist/holonomy bounds.
If a corridor requires element-specific gates, failure to satisfy primary gates yields FAIL; secondary gates may yield NEAR/AMBIG depending on corridor.
10.1.2.4 Operational equivalence and ISA-normal forms
The ISA supports canonicalization: two programs are operationally equivalent if they produce the same effect and preserve the same invariants under the same corridor.
Definition 10.14 (Operational equivalence). Two instruction sequences (P,Q) are operationally equivalent for a target claim if:
they are admissible on the same declared region,
they produce outputs equal within corridor tolerances (or identical in strict corridors),
they preserve the required invariant suite,
any commuting square obligations between alternative routes close within thresholds.
Operational equivalence is certified by EQUIV edges whose payload includes the invariant suite and defect bounds, and by commuting-diagram witnesses (Chapter 5.2).
10.1.3 Algorithms
10.1.3.1 Enumerate the ISA and build the Op registry
Algorithm 10.15 (BuildISARegistry). Input: canonical axis enumerations, corridor policy set, seed objects for constants. Output: registry mapping OpAddr → Op.
Steps:
Enumerate all (\mathrm{OpAddr}\in\mathcal C\times\mathcal L\times\mathcal E\times\mathcal K).
For each OpAddr:
assign Sig and typed InType/OutType templates appropriate to the lens and level,
attach element-specific admissibility gates and NoGoSpec,
attach witness and replay requirements derived from level and corridor.
Normalize Op objects to canonical NF and assign GlobalAddr atoms to each instruction.
Create REF edges from Chapter 10 to each Op atom; seal the registry module under L3 operations.
The registry is immutable: changes require a new edition or schema migration via MIGRATE edges (Chapter 5).
10.1.3.2 Compile-time no-go detection: static analysis over Op programs
The compiler performs no-go detection as static analysis before executing or sealing operations.
Algorithm 10.16 (NoGoStaticCheck). Input: instruction sequence (P=(\mathrm{Op}_1,\ldots,\mathrm{Op}_n)), declared region (S), corridor. Output: PASS/AMBIG/FAIL plus obligations/evidence plan.
Static checks:
Type checking and domain guard composition (Chapter 2 and 3).
Branch safety and singularity exclusion checks (Water gates).
Structural invariants and lattice preservation checks (Earth gates).
Growth/stability region checks and resonance/alias risks (Fire gates).
Commutation/twist/holonomy feasibility checks for multistep routes (Air gates).
Identify any instruction whose NoGoSpec is triggered by the composed guards or by missing certificates.
If a no-go is detected by a certified lower bound or an explicit illegal pattern, output FAIL with minimal witness. If detection requires missing data (e.g., unknown Jacobian bounds), output AMBIG with an evidence plan to decide.
10.1.3.3 Program normalization into ISA normal form
Algorithm 10.17 (CanonicalizeOpProgram). Input: instruction sequence (P), corridor. Output: canonical program (P^\star) and equivalence witnesses.
Steps:
Remove neutral L0 operations that are definitional aliases already expanded in NF.
Factor non-adjacent lens changes into adjacent sequences (DUAL discipline).
Apply parity decomposition to separate even/odd channels and eliminate gauge-only detours where corridor permits (Chapter 9).
Merge consecutive compatible transports into composed transforms when admissible and when witnesses allow, without hiding domain/branch constraints.
Reorder commuting operations only when commuting-diagram witnesses exist or can be generated within budget.
Output includes:
canonical program,
commuting diagram obligations and witnesses,
updated defect propagation ledgers.
10.1.3.4 Seal an ISA program: produce LinkEdges, certificates, and replays
Algorithm 10.18 (SealProgram). Input: canonical program (P^\star), corridor, target claim address. Output: L3 artifacts: LinkEdges, certificates, minimal witness sets.
Steps:
Execute the program under deterministic replay policy; record transcript commitments.
Collect witness artifacts: defect ledgers, invariant checks, domain/branch audits.
Evaluate corridor truth; if OK/NEAR, assemble minimal witness set.
Emit LinkEdges:
IMPL edges binding algorithmic artifacts to specs when applicable,
PROOF edges binding proof artifacts,
EQUIV/DUAL edges for equivalence transports,
GEN/INST edges for generated artifacts,
CONFLICT edges if contradictions or no-go events are found.
Seal the result as a module if it forms a reusable subgraph; run regression checks.
Sealing is forbidden if the program is AMBIG without an evidence plan or if no-go failures remain unresolved.
10.1.4 Certificates
10.1.4.1 ISA registry integrity cert
Certifies:
completeness of enumeration (exactly 256 instructions),
uniqueness and canonical NF of each Op object,
correct OpAddr mapping,
correct witness/replay requirement profiles per level and element,
referential closure of registry module.
10.1.4.2 Type-and-domain safety certs for ISA programs
Certifies:
type correctness of the program,
composed domain admissibility and branch coherence,
absence of unguarded singularity crossings,
satisfaction of element-specific primary gates required by corridor.
10.1.4.3 Compile-time no-go detection certs
Certifies:
static check results and their determinism,
identified no-go triggers and minimal witnesses,
completeness of evidence plans for AMBIG outcomes,
correctness of FAIL outcomes with obstruction/lower bound artifacts where applicable.
10.1.4.4 Program sealing and replay closure certs
Certifies:
deterministic replay of the program under pinned kernels and randomness policies,
correctness of generated LinkEdges and their payload commitments,
closure under corridor truth lattice requirements (Chapter 4),
regression stability for sealed artifacts.
10.2 Flower — Equivalence moves, symmetry coherence, and the ISA as a groupoid
10.2.1 Objects
10.2.1.1 The ISA groupoid view and lens adjacency structure
Flower interprets the ISA as generators of a rotation/equivalence groupoid.
Definition 10.19 (ISA morphisms). Each L1 instruction corresponds to a morphism between presentations in the rotation groupoid (Chapter 3.2). L3 instructions seal those morphisms as LinkEdges (Chapter 5).
The atlas adjacency constraint induces a restricted generating set for lens movement; DUAL instructions are the primitive adjacent moves.
10.2.1.2 Symmetry metadata, gauge objects, and commuting-diagram witnesses
Flower operations carry symmetry metadata and must provide commuting diagrams for equivalence claims. Gauge objects and parity (\chi) objects (Chapter 9) define allowable quotienting of routes.
10.2.1.3 Invariant suite gates and defect spec objects in EQUIV instructions
EQUIV instructions are defined by:
transport map (T),
invariant suite to preserve,
defect metrics and tolerances,
budget and corridor policies.
These objects ensure that equivalence is never asserted without measurable and certifiable invariants.
10.2.1.4 Holonomy and obstruction records as ISA-level artifacts
Holonomy and obstruction objects are first-class ISA outcomes:
nonzero holonomy indicates gauge drift or inconsistent branch conventions,
obstruction indicates a no-go that cannot be resolved by allowable moves.
Such objects are sealed by L3 instructions and contribute to the no-go lattice.
10.2.2 Calculus
10.2.2.1 Commuting squares generated by ISA programs
Every reordering and every alternative route in the ISA induces commuting-square obligations. Flower calculus defines when operations commute (or commute up to bounded defect) and requires witnesses for any commutation used in program normalization.
10.2.2.2 Symmetry-compatibility corridors and admissible instruction subsets
Corridors define subsets of the ISA that are admissible under specific symmetry requirements (e.g., unitary-only corridors restrict basis swaps; lattice corridors restrict transforms to discrete subgroups). The ISA is therefore corridor-parametric: admissibility is not solely a property of the instruction but of instruction + corridor + domain.
10.2.2.3 Bounded conjugacy vs obstruction as ISA-level classification
Flower calculus defines when a transform is:
exact conjugacy (OK),
bounded conjugacy (NEAR),
non-conjugate with certified lower bound (FAIL obstruction).
This classification is encoded as ISA-level tags and used by compile-time no-go detection.
10.2.2.4 Normal forms and canonical route selection under symmetry
Route canonicalization in Flower uses:
minimal defect bounds,
symmetry-coherent gauge choices,
parity-aware reductions,
deterministic tie-breaks.Canonical route selection is itself an ISA operation (L3 sealing) that produces EQUIV edges and diagram witnesses.
10.2.3 Algorithms
10.2.3.1 Symmetry-aware ISA program search
Search for programs that achieve a target transform while satisfying invariant gates, using:
invariant signatures as filters,
adjacency constraints,
corridor admissibility checks,
bounded loop enumeration for holonomy.
10.2.3.2 Diagram synthesis and holonomy computation as compiler passes
Compiler passes generate:
commuting-diagram witnesses for route equivalence,
holonomy records for cycles,
obstruction packages when defects admit lower bounds.
10.2.3.3 Parity-aware normalization and gauge-fix insertion
Insert gauge-fixing operations where necessary and permitted to stabilize odd-channel ambiguity; verify parity commutation where required.
10.2.3.4 Sealing equivalence: emit EQUIV/DUAL edges with full witnesses
Seal all equivalence programs by emitting:
EQUIV/DUAL LinkEdges,
defect ledgers,
invariant suite gates,
replay scripts and minimal witness sets.
10.2.4 Certificates
10.2.4.1 Diagram commutation certs for ISA rewrites
Certify that any ISA rewrite or program normalization preserves semantics via commuting squares and bounded defects.
10.2.4.2 Symmetry and lattice preservation certs for admissible instruction sets
Certify that programs respect corridor-required symmetries and discrete invariants; violations are sealed as FAIL no-go outcomes.
10.2.4.3 Holonomy-boundedness certs for canonicalization
Certify that holonomy is bounded for canonical routes and gauge conventions; otherwise quarantine and block OK sealing.
10.2.4.4 Equivalence sealing certs for EQUIV/DUAL operations
Certify that EQUIV/DUAL edges satisfy invariant gates, defect bounds, and replay determinism, and are admissible under the corridor.
10.3 Cloud — Anti-expressions, probabilistic no-go, and uncertainty-aware ISA constraints
10.3.1 Objects
10.3.1.1 The 64 no-go lattice as an anti-expression object
The no-go lattice enumerates forbidden operation patterns (“anti-expressions”) that the compiler must detect.
Definition 10.20 (No-go classes). The no-go lattice is indexed by:
lens (\ell\in\mathcal L) and level (k\in{L0,L1,L2,L3}), yielding (4\times 4=16) slots,
each slot contains one of four canonical no-go types (Earth/Water/Fire/Air), yielding (16\times 4=64) anti-expressions.
An anti-expression object is:[\mathrm{NoGo}:=(\mathrm{NoGoAddr},\ \mathrm{NoGoType},\ \mathrm{TriggerPattern},\ \mathrm{ViolationPredicate},\ \mathrm{LowerBoundWitness},\ \mathrm{RepairMoves},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]where:
NoGoAddr = ((\ell,k,e)) or equivalently ((\ell,k,\mathrm{NoGoType})),
TriggerPattern is a static signature pattern over operations, domains, and certificates,
ViolationPredicate is a formal condition that constitutes failure,
LowerBoundWitness is evidence for FAIL (or requirements for evidence plan when undecidable),
RepairMoves enumerates permitted remediation operations (route change, domain refinement, gauge fix, corridor change, or abstention).
10.3.1.2 Probabilistic no-go types and failure modes under uncertainty
Cloud no-go types include:
unidentifiability/alias cones that prevent unique inference,
unbounded estimator variance under heavy tails without robust methods,
lack of mixing guarantees for Markov-based estimators,
non-replayable stochastic pipelines (unpinned randomness).
These are represented as NoGo objects whose violation predicates are expressed in terms of risk vectors and missing certificates, and whose repair moves include robust estimator substitution and evidence plans.
10.3.1.3 Anti-expression taxonomies by level
No-go classification is level-sensitive:
L0 anti-expressions: illegal definitional identities (domain expansion, hidden branch changes).
L1 anti-expressions: illegal transports (singularity crossing, non-invertible inverse used as bijection, lattice violation).
L2 anti-expressions: illegal algorithms (unstable time-stepping, blow-up, uncontrolled variance).
L3 anti-expressions: illegal sealing (missing closure, non-deterministic replay, conflict suppression).
Each anti-expression records what “illegal” means at that level and which evidence makes the illegality decidable.
10.3.1.4 No-go witness objects and abstention artifacts
No-go detection outputs:
FAIL with minimal witness when violation is certified,
AMBIG with evidence plan when undecidable within corridor budgets,
quarantine overlays when no-go affects downstream claims.
These outputs are first-class artifacts in the MyceliumGraph and are referenced by corridor truth logic (Chapter 4).
10.3.2 Calculus
10.3.2.1 No-go predicates as static safety contracts
No-go predicates are formal safety contracts enforced before sealing.
Rule 10.21 (No-go enforcement). An ISA program may not be sealed (L3) if any NoGo predicate is triggered and not discharged by certificates. Discharge conditions are:
prove the predicate false by certificates,
restrict the domain so the predicate does not apply,
change corridor to one that permits the behavior explicitly (with downgrade), or
abstain with evidence plan.
10.3.2.2 Uncertainty-aware no-go: when bounds are required vs optional
Cloud calculus distinguishes:
missing bounds that are required (force AMBIG/FAIL),
optional diagnostics (affect confidence but not admissibility),all specified by corridor.
10.3.2.3 Data-processing and identifiability boundaries as no-go triggers
Non-invertible compressions trigger information loss; any claim that requires recovery of lost information is a no-go unless additional observables are introduced.
10.3.2.4 Composition of no-go constraints through pipelines
No-go predicates compose: a single violated stage contaminates the entire pipeline for sealing. The compiler must trace minimal cores (like conflict minimal cores) to produce minimal no-go witnesses.
10.3.3 Algorithms
10.3.3.1 Static trigger matching for anti-expression patterns
Detect known anti-expression trigger patterns over:
type mismatches,
domain/branch inconsistencies,
missing certificates,
risk vectors and tail regime failures,
replay nondeterminism.
10.3.3.2 Minimal no-go core extraction
Compute the minimal set of steps/assumptions causing the no-go, producing a minimal witness package suitable for FAIL certification and for remediation planning.
10.3.3.3 Evidence-plan synthesis for undecidable no-go triggers
When no-go status depends on missing bounds, synthesize evidence plans to decide:
compute Jacobian lower bounds,
run mixing diagnostics,
run robust tail checks,
compute holonomy or twist bounds,within pinned budgets.
10.3.3.4 Quarantine overlay generation for no-go regions
Generate quarantine overlays that block downstream OK sealing until the no-go is resolved, and attach explicit repair move sets.
10.3.4 Certificates
10.3.4.1 No-go completeness cert (coverage of triggers)
Certify that the compiler’s no-go checker covers the declared 64 anti-expression slots and that trigger patterns are evaluated deterministically.
10.3.4.2 No-go discharge certs (proof that a trigger is avoided)
Certify that a triggered no-go predicate is discharged by:
domain restriction,
added certificates,
modified corridor with explicit downgrade semantics,
or substitution of robust algorithms.
10.3.4.3 Risk-bound and identifiability certs for Cloud no-go
Certify tail regime, mixing bounds, and identifiability conditions needed to avoid probabilistic no-go failures.
10.3.4.4 Replay determinism certs for L3 sealing safety
Certify that stochastic pipelines (if allowed) are replayable under pinned randomness and that transcripts match commitments.
10.4 Fractal — ISA across scales: level lifting, multiscale compilation, and holographic enforcement
10.4.1 Objects
10.4.1.1 Multiscale ISA programs and scale-indexed OpAddr
Fractal treats ISA programs as multiscale objects: each instruction may have scale-indexed parameters (grid size, truncation order, resolution level) and must obey tightening schedules (Chapter 4.4).
10.4.1.2 Cross-scale no-go: twist, drift, and false universality anti-expressions
Fractal no-go types include:
noncommutation of coarse-grain and rotation (twist defect),
invariant drift beyond tightening schedule,
false universality (apparent equivalence due to insufficient observables).
These are encoded as no-go objects whose predicates require multiscale certificates (RP≈I, contraction, drift bounds).
10.4.1.3 Seeded ISA programs and compressed compilation artifacts
Fractal ISA programs are stored as seeds that can be expanded into detailed scripts and re-compressed idempotently. The seed includes:
canonical program normal form,
multiscale budgets,
required certificates and replays,
invariant suites across scales.
10.4.1.4 Extraction indices and holographic routing maps
Fractal layer builds extraction indices mapping:
OpAddr programs → invariants and no-go checks,
scale ladders → tightening schedules,
canonical routes → shortest certified paths via invariant gates,supporting “zoom” operations that retrieve coarse understanding or expand into full proof-carrying detail.
10.4.2 Calculus
10.4.2.1 Tightening schedules as ISA semantics
Fractal calculus treats levels as refinement tiers: L2/L3 operations may be re-run at finer scales; their validity depends on tightened budgets and invariant stability. Promotion to OK requires stability across scale ladder.
10.4.2.2 Multiscale equivalence and universality gates as ISA constraints
Fractal ISA programs that claim equivalence must specify whether equivalence is exact or universal-equivalent; universality claims require multiscale invariants and contraction certificates.
10.4.2.3 Drift and twist defects as compile-time no-go triggers
Twist defects between coarse-grain and rotation and drift of invariants are treated as compile-time no-go triggers for sealing universality claims.
10.4.2.4 Safety against recursive explosion in ISA expansion
Fractal expansion must obey recursion budgets; if expansion would exceed budgets, the system returns AMBIG with a finite evidence plan, never partial OK sealing.
10.4.3 Algorithms
10.4.3.1 Multiscale ISA compilation pipeline
Compile ISA programs across a scale ladder:
build coarse program,
refine and correct at finer scales,
propagate defect bounds,
seal at L3 only when all levels pass.
10.4.3.2 Multiscale no-go checking and quarantine escalation
Evaluate cross-scale no-go predicates:
twist defects,
drift bounds,
contraction failures,and generate quarantine overlays when thresholds are violated.
10.4.3.3 Seed compression of ISA programs with idempotent expansion
Compress multiscale ISA programs into seeds with compression contracts; attach replay transcripts and certificates to ensure deterministic regeneration.
10.4.3.4 Automatic extraction index generation for the ISA
Generate indices that allow:
rapid lookup of operations by axis coordinates,
retrieval of no-go predicates and repair moves,
retrieval of canonical program normal forms,
retrieval of invariants and certificates required by corridor.
10.4.4 Certificates
10.4.4.1 Multiscale ISA correctness certs
Certify that multiscale ISA programs are consistent across scales and satisfy tightening schedules.
10.4.4.2 Cross-scale no-go discharge certs
Certify that twist/drift no-go triggers are avoided or bounded, enabling sealing.
10.4.4.3 Seed integrity certs for ISA program compression/expansion
Certify compression contracts and replay determinism for ISA program seeds.
10.4.4.4 ISA extraction completeness certs
Certify that extraction indices cover all 256 operations and all 64 no-go slots, and that lookup and compilation are deterministic.
CHAPTER 10 — THE 256-OPERATION CRYSTAL ISA + 64 NO-GO LATTICE (Addr ⟨0021⟩₄)
Chapter 11 — Discrete Metro Engines: (\mathbb Z_{15}\ /\ \mathbb Z_{12}\ /) Semidirect Products (Addr ⟨0022⟩₄)
11.1 Square — Station rings, step automata, and quotient/fiber decoders
11.1.1 Objects
11.1.1.1 MetroEngine objects on (\mathbb Z_N) and ring-state encodings
A Discrete Metro Engine is a finite-state dynamical system whose latent state is a residue class and whose observable is a station label obtained by a fixed decode map.
Definition 11.1 (Ring engine). A ring engine is a tuple[\mathfrak M_N := (U,\ \mathrm{StepSet},\ \mathrm{Decode},\ \mathrm{Label},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]where:
(U:=\mathbb Z_N) is the latent ring state.
(\mathrm{StepSet}\subseteq \mathbb Z_N) is the permitted set of step increments.
(\mathrm{Decode}:U\to \mathcal S) is a decode map to a station space (\mathcal S) (finite).
(\mathrm{Label}:\mathcal S\to \mathfrak L) assigns canonical station labels.
Meta pins admissibility, corridor policy bindings, and replay obligations.
Definition 11.2 (Spin-step operator). For a step parameter (R\in\mathbb Z_N), define the spin-step:[S_+(R): u \mapsto u+R \pmod N.]On the 45-bin projection (coarse shadow), the state is explicitly (u\in \mathbb Z_{45}) and the step is (u\mapsto u+R\pmod{45}).
Definition 11.3 (Cycle invariants of a ring step). For (S_+(R)) on (\mathbb Z_N), define the conserved residue class:[I_{\gcd}(u) := u \bmod \gcd(N,R),]which is invariant along orbits of (S_+(R)). On (\mathbb Z_{45}), the cycle length is (45/\gcd(45,R)) and (u\bmod \gcd(45,R)) is conserved.
The ring engine is the Square-layer “hardware” of the metro: all downstream routing, tunneling, and no-go analysis reduces to algebra over (\mathbb Z_N) plus certified decode maps.
11.1.1.2 The (\mathbb Z_{45}\to(\mathbb Z_{15}\times\mathbb Z_3)) decoder and station observables
A canonical metro observation is obtained by factoring a ring state into a coarse station and a subphase.
Definition 11.4 (15×3 decode on the 45 shadow). On (U=\mathbb Z_{45}), define:[\sigma(u):=\left\lfloor \frac{u}{3}\right\rfloor \in \mathbb Z_{15},\qquad \tau(u):=u\bmod 3 \in \mathbb Z_3.]This decode is explicitly used in the 45-bin system, where (\sigma\in \mathbb Z_{15}) and (\tau\in\mathbb Z_3).
Definition 11.5 (Station ring). The station ring is (\mathbb Z_{15}) with canonical indexing ({0,\dots,14}). The subphase ring is (\mathbb Z_3). The observable metro state is:[\mathrm{Obs}(u) := (\sigma(u),\tau(u)) \in \mathbb Z_{15}\times \mathbb Z_3.]
Definition 11.6 (Boundary phase quantization origin). The ring state (u) can be interpreted as a quantized boundary phase: (u:=\lfloor 45\psi\rfloor), so (u\mapsto u+R) corresponds to (\psi\mapsto \psi+R/45) (mod 1) and thus (\Theta\mapsto \Theta+2\pi R/45).
Definition 11.7 (Observable semantics). (\sigma) is the coarse “metro station,” (\tau) is the triangle subphase. The 15×3 observable grid is thus the deterministic discretization of a boundary phase gate: which station you are in and which subphase you are in are both driven by the single integer (u).
11.1.1.3 Octave scaling operators and the metro gear algebra
The metro engine includes a scaling action (“octave lift”) that rescales step sizes and changes observable itineraries.
Definition 11.8 (Octave scaling on step size). An octave-lift changes the step parameter (R) by multiplication by 3:[R \mapsto 3R,]so the phase increment (\Delta(R)=R/45) scales as (\Delta(3R)=3\Delta(R)).
Definition 11.9 (Tetrahedron closure relation). The scaling operator (E) acting on the step dynamics satisfies:[E,S,E^{-1} = S^3,]interpreted as “expanding one octave triples the boundary phase step.”
Definition 11.10 (Gear projection sequence). Under scaling of (R), the coarse ring can transition between cycle regimes (e.g., 45-cycle (\to) 15-cycle (\to) 5-cycle) via changes in (\gcd(N,R)) and induced projections on (\sigma). The 45-shadow explicitly exhibits corridor partitions once (R) is divisible by (9) (since (\gcd(45,R)=9) yields 5-cycles).
11.1.1.4 Quotient/fiber viewpoint: coarse station (\sigma) and hidden remainder (q)
Beyond the 45-shadow, the refined metro engine is defined on a higher modulus where the 15-station label is a coarse quotient and the remaining digits form a hidden fiber.
Definition 11.11 (Refined circle modulus). Fix a refinement index (d\ge 3). Define the refined modulus:[M_d := 15\cdot 3^{d+4} = 5\cdot 3^{d+5}.]
Definition 11.12 (Refined decode). For (u\in \mathbb Z_{M_d}), define:[\sigma(u) := \left\lfloor \frac{u}{3^{d+4}}\right\rfloor \in \mathbb Z_{15},\qquad q(u):=u\bmod 3^{d+4}.]
Thus (\sigma) is the quotient digit (station), while (q) is the full internal remainder (fiber coordinate). In the refined regime, the observable station is a quotient projection and the hidden state is a fiber; tunneling phenomena later arise when dynamics change only (\sigma) while preserving (q).
11.1.2 Calculus
11.1.2.1 Cycle decomposition in (\mathbb Z_N): gcd law and conserved residues
Cycle structure of a ring translation is completely determined by (\gcd(N,R)).
Proposition 11.13 (Orbit length). For (S_+(R):u\mapsto u+R) on (\mathbb Z_N), every orbit has length:[L=\frac{N}{\gcd(N,R)},]and there are (\gcd(N,R)) disjoint cycles, indexed by the invariant residue (u\bmod \gcd(N,R)). For (N=45), (L=45/\gcd(45,R)), with invariant (u\bmod \gcd(45,R)).
Corollary 11.14 (Conserved subphase condition on the 45 shadow). If (R\equiv 0 \pmod 3), then (\tau(u)=u\bmod 3) is invariant under (u\mapsto u+R). In the 45-shadow analysis, (\tau) is conserved when the step is a multiple of 3.
11.1.2.2 Projection dynamics: (\sigma)-advance rules and corridor families
The station projection (\sigma) inherits a deterministic update rule from the ring translation.
Proposition 11.15 ((\sigma)-advance on the 45 shadow). For (u\mapsto u+R) on (\mathbb Z_{45}) with (\sigma=\lfloor u/3\rfloor), if (R\equiv 0\pmod 3) then:[\Delta\sigma \equiv \frac{R}{3}\pmod{15}.]For example, (R=27) yields (\Delta\sigma=9\pmod{15}).
Proposition 11.16 (Refined snap (\sigma)-advance). In the refined system at the snap stride (s=3^{d+5}), since (3^{d+5}=3\cdot 3^{d+4}), the quotient digit advances by (+3\pmod{15}):[\sigma(u_{t+1})\equiv \sigma(u_t)+3\pmod{15}.]
Definition 11.17 (Corridor families by residue class). The station ring (\mathbb Z_{15}) partitions into three residue classes mod 3. Under (+3) stepping, each class forms a 5-cycle. The refined analysis explicitly lists the three 5-cycles indexed by (\sigma\bmod 3).
11.1.2.3 Refined modulus calculus: snap regime, stride law, and fiber freezing prerequisites
The refined metro engine is parameterized by two indices:
(d): the refinement depth (modulus size),
(n): the octave index controlling step size (s=3^{n+5}).
Definition 11.18 (Refined step). In the refined system:[u \mapsto u+s \pmod{M_d},\qquad s=3^{n+5}.]
Proposition 11.19 (Orbit length in the refined system). With (M_d=15\cdot 3^{d+4}) and step (s=3^{n+5}),[L(d,n)=\frac{M_d}{\gcd(M_d,s)}=\begin{cases}5\cdot 3^{d-n} & n\le d,\5 & n\ge d.\end{cases}]
Definition 11.20 (Snap regime). At snap octave (n=d), the step equals (s=3^{d+5}) and (\gcd(M_d,s)=3^{d+5}), yielding orbit length exactly 5:[L(d,d)=5.]
Rule 11.21 (Fiber-freeze precondition). The fiber coordinate is (q(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}). Under additive stepping (u\mapsto u+s), the fiber is invariant when (s\equiv 0\pmod{3^{d+4}}). At snap (s=3^{d+5}=3\cdot 3^{d+4}), the remainder is exactly invariant: (q(u_{t+1})=q(u_t)).
11.1.2.4 Routing geometry on rings: Cayley graphs, step-sets, and discrete geodesics
The Square routing geometry is the Cayley-graph geometry induced by a step-set.
Definition 11.22 (Cayley graph of a ring engine). Given ((U=\mathbb Z_N,\mathrm{StepSet})), define the directed Cayley graph:[\mathrm{Cay}(U,\mathrm{StepSet})\ \text{with edges}\ u\to u+s\ \ (s\in \mathrm{StepSet}).]The station-level Cayley graph is obtained by quotienting through (\sigma) (or the relevant decode map), producing edges between station indices induced by step increments.
Definition 11.23 (Admissible route). An admissible route from station (a) to station (b) is a finite word in step generators that maps some admissible latent state in the fiber over (a) to a latent state in the fiber over (b), under corridor constraints on domains/branches and permitted step indices.
Definition 11.24 (Discrete geodesic cost). A cost function assigns edge weights (w(s)) (possibly corridor-dependent). The geodesic distance is the minimal total weight over admissible words. In strict corridors, admissibility is a hard constraint; in NEAR corridors, admissibility may be probabilistic or toleranced, with explicit ledgers (Chapter 4).
11.1.3 Algorithms
11.1.3.1 Build a metro engine from ((N,\mathrm{Decode},\mathrm{StepSet}))
Algorithm 11.25 (BuildMetroEngine). Inputs: modulus (N), decode map (\mathrm{Decode}), step-set (\mathrm{StepSet}), station label function. Output: (\mathfrak M_N) with canonical normal forms.
function BuildMetroEngine(N, Decode, StepSet, Label, Policy):
U := Z_N
verify Decode is total on U or produce Dom guards
verify StepSet ⊆ Z_N
define step operator S_+(s): u -> (u+s) mod N for each s in StepSet
define station space S := image(Decode)
define labeled stations L := Label(S) with canonical ordering
return MetroEngine(U, StepSet, Decode, Label, Meta(Policy))
For the 45-shadow, the canonical decoder is (\sigma=\lfloor u/3\rfloor), (\tau=u\bmod 3).
11.1.3.2 Compute cycle decomposition and conserved residues
Algorithm 11.26 (CycleDecomposeRingStep). Inputs: (N,R). Output: cycle length (L), number of cycles, and invariant class label.
function CycleDecomposeRingStep(N, R):
g := gcd(N, R)
L := N / g
cycles := g
invariant := (u mod g) // conserved label
return (L, cycles, invariant)
On (N=45), the formula (L=45/\gcd(45,R)) and conservation of (u\bmod \gcd(45,R)) are explicit.
11.1.3.3 Compute station-level transition induced by a step
Algorithm 11.27 (ProjectStepToStations). Inputs: decoder (\sigma), step (R), admissibility conditions (e.g., (R\equiv 0\pmod 3) for clean (\sigma)-advance on the 45-shadow). Output: station increment rule and subphase invariants.
function ProjectStepToStations(Nshadow, R):
// Example: Nshadow=45, sigma=floor(u/3), tau=u mod 3
if R mod 3 == 0:
delta_sigma := (R/3) mod 15
tau_invariant := true
else:
delta_sigma := AMBIG // depends on boundary convention
tau_invariant := false
return (delta_sigma, tau_invariant)
The relation (\Delta\sigma=R/3\pmod{15}) for (R\equiv 0\pmod 3) is explicitly computed in the 45-shadow analysis.
11.1.3.4 Compile a station route into a replayable latent-state script
Algorithm 11.28 (CompileStationRoute). Inputs: start station (a), target station (b), step-set, corridor policy, and (optionally) a fiber state constraint. Output: a deterministic script that realizes the route or returns AMBIG with evidence plan.
function CompileStationRoute(a, b, StepSet, Policy):
candidates := shortest_paths_on_station_graph(a, b, StepSet, Policy.cost)
for path in candidates (deterministic order):
if admissible_under_policy(path, Policy):
return ReplayScript(path, obligations=∅)
return AMBIG(EvidencePlan to refine admissibility / infer fiber constraints)
In refined systems, admissibility may require fiber constraints (hidden remainder) to be specified; lacking this yields AMBIG by corridor law (Chapter 4).
11.1.4 Certificates
11.1.4.1 Decode correctness cert (ring (\to) station × subphase)
Certifies that the decoder is well-defined and consistent with the ring modulus.
For the 45-shadow:
(\sigma(u)=\lfloor u/3\rfloor\in\mathbb Z_{15}) and (\tau=u\bmod 3\in\mathbb Z_3) are well-defined for all (u\in\mathbb Z_{45}).For refined (M_d):
(\sigma(u)=\lfloor u/3^{d+4}\rfloor\in\mathbb Z_{15}) and (q(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}) are well-defined and pinned.
Certificate includes:
canonical decoder definition,
admissible domain and boundary convention (if quantization is defined by floor),
replay transcript verifying decoder outputs on a pinned exhaustive set or by structural proof.
11.1.4.2 Cycle decomposition cert for step dynamics
Certifies orbit length and conserved residues for (S_+(R)) on (\mathbb Z_N).
For (\mathbb Z_{45}), certifies (L=45/\gcd(45,R)) and invariance of (u\bmod \gcd(45,R)).For refined (M_d), certifies orbit length formula and snap length (L(d,d)=5).
11.1.4.3 Octave scaling cert and step-rescaling coherence
Certifies the octave-rescaling law and its induced “gear” effects.
Key obligations:
step scaling (\Delta(3R)=3\Delta(R)),
conjugacy closure (ESE^{-1}=S^3),
induced corridor partition invariants are preserved under the scaling maps when required by corridor.
11.1.4.4 Quotient/fiber integrity cert
Certifies that the quotient station (\sigma) and fiber coordinate ((\tau) or (q)) form a valid decomposition and that declared invariants behave as claimed.
In the refined snap regime, certifies:
(\sigma(u_{t+1})\equiv \sigma(u_t)+3\pmod{15}),
(q(u_{t+1})=q(u_t)) (fiber frozen).
This certificate is a prerequisite for treating station changes as “chart moves” with hidden-state preservation in later tunneling chapters.
11.2 Flower — Semidirect-product engines and synchronization geometry ((\mathbb Z_{15},\mathbb Z_{12},\mathbb Z_{18}))
11.2.1 Objects
11.2.1.1 The semidirect product world engine and the 12-cycle archetype space
Flower formalizes the metro as a structured group action: a 3-phase operator acting on a 4-state basis, producing a 12-state archetype wheel.
Definition 11.29 (Square–Triangle composite). Let the Square element basis be (\mathbb Z_4) and the Triangle phase operator be (\mathbb Z_3). The composite generates 12 archetypes, expressed as (E\times T\cong 12), where (T={0,1,2}) indexes the 3-phase cycle.
Definition 11.30 (Semidirect product form). The engine is specified as:[\mathbb Z_4 \rtimes \mathbb Z_3 \quad \text{with closure on}\quad S^1,]interpreted as: Square provides the 4-state basis, Triangle provides the 3-step traversal law acting on it, and the circle provides phase closure so the action repeats across octaves.
This is the Flower-layer algebraic kernel behind discrete metro wheels: it states that a 12-cycle can be generated by a 3-phase grammar acting on a 4-state content basis, with wrap-around provided by the circle.
11.2.1.2 Tandem clock overlays: (\mathbb Z_{12}\leftrightarrow \mathbb Z_{18}) and sextile nexus set
The “octave” metro is represented as overlay of two discrete coordinate systems.
Definition 11.31 (12/18 overlay). Consider a 12-grid with step 30° and an 18-grid with step 20°. The overlay induces a 24-cell segmentation of the circle (joint regions).
Definition 11.32 (Sextile nexus set). The first nontrivial shared intersection of the 12- and 18-grids occurs at 60°:[2\cdot 30^\circ = 60^\circ,\qquad 3\cdot 20^\circ = 60^\circ,]so 60° is the minimal shared step (LCM of 30 and 20), defining the sextile tunnel set:[\theta = 0^\circ,60^\circ,120^\circ,180^\circ,240^\circ,300^\circ\ (\text{mod }360^\circ),]a 6-cycle backbone.
Definition 11.33 (Discrete sextile move). In the 12-cycle, sextile is “advance by 60°,” i.e.[s \mapsto s\pm 2 \pmod{12}.]
11.2.1.3 Hex backbone and routing geometry objects
Flower packages the metro geometry as a graph of admissible “easy” edges.
Definition 11.34 (Hex backbone). The sextile nexus set is a 6-cycle skeleton. In the tandem encoding, both the 12-cycle and 18-cycle “snap” onto this 6-cycle.
Definition 11.35 (Refinement hierarchy of 6, 12, 18). The 6-fold structure is the hub; 12 and 18 are refinements obtained by splitting each 60° sector into 2 or 3 parts respectively.
Definition 11.36 (Edge types). Edge types are classified by their relation to the backbone:
backbone edges: preserve synchronization between coordinate systems (low coherence cost),
off-grid edges: move within one coordinate system but break synchronization; require compensating moves or a “grounding” step to re-lock.
11.2.1.4 Diagram and holonomy objects for multi-coordinate routing
When multiple coordinate systems coexist, route equivalence requires commuting diagrams and holonomy audits (Chapters 3–5). Flower represents:
commuting squares between different coordinate routes,
holonomy around loops that include re-locking operations,as addressable artifacts for corridor truth evaluation.
11.2.2 Calculus
11.2.2.1 Semidirect product law and the action of (\mathbb Z_3) on (\mathbb Z_4)
The semidirect product (\mathbb Z_4\rtimes\mathbb Z_3) is defined by specifying a homomorphism:[\varphi:\mathbb Z_3 \to \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb Z_4),]encoding how the 3-phase operator permutes the 4-state basis. The admissible choices of (\varphi) are corridor-pinned and define the transition grammar. The resulting group law on pairs ((e,t)\in \mathbb Z_4\times \mathbb Z_3) is:[(e_1,t_1)\cdot (e_2,t_2) := (e_1+\varphi(t_1)(e_2),\ t_1+t_2).]This formalizes “Triangle is the 3 that acts on the 4,” and yields (E\times T\cong 12) as the archetype space.
11.2.2.2 Synchronization calculus: intersections as LCM steps
Clock synchronization is a discrete intersection problem.
Proposition 11.37 (Intersection step). For two uniform partitions of (S^1) with step sizes (\alpha) and (\beta), the minimal nontrivial shared boundary step is (\mathrm{lcm}(\alpha,\beta)) (in angular units). For the 12/18 overlay, (\mathrm{lcm}(30^\circ,20^\circ)=60^\circ), giving the sextile nexus.
Rule 11.38 (Lockstep index update at nexus). At a nexus angle (\theta=60n), indices satisfy (k=\theta/30=2n) and (m=\theta/20=3n), so the sextile move increments them as:[(k,m)\mapsto (k+2,\ m+3).]
11.2.2.3 Adjacency discipline as routing geometry
Adjacency rules restrict which edges are considered “stable corridors.”
Rule 11.39 (Backbone routing). Backbone routing uses edges that remain aligned to the 60° skeleton. In the 12-cycle, these are ±2 moves; in the 18-cycle, these are ±3 moves. Backbone routing minimizes re-lock cost and is treated as the canonical low-(\Omega) route class.
Rule 11.40 (Off-grid move semantics). Any move not aligned to the backbone is a composite: it must be accompanied by compensating steps or by an explicit grounding/collapse operation to return to synchronization. These composites are expressed as instruction words and must be justified by commuting diagrams if multiple decompositions exist.
11.2.2.4 Holonomy and multi-chart curvature in discrete routing
When routing uses multiple coordinate systems and re-lock operations, loops can accumulate drift.
Definition 11.41 (Holonomy defect for discrete routing). For a loop (\gamma) in the metro graph expressed as a word in generators, the holonomy defect is the defect between:
the composed action of (\gamma) on a pinned anchor state,
the identity action,measured in a pinned metric or exact equality. Nonzero holonomy indicates inconsistent gauge conventions or missing equivalence witnesses, and triggers quarantine in strict corridors (Chapters 4–5).
11.2.3 Algorithms
11.2.3.1 Compute tandem overlay cells and nexus points
Algorithm 11.42 (ComputeOverlayAndNexus). Inputs: (N_1=12), (N_2=18). Output: joint segmentation and nexus set.
function ComputeOverlayAndNexus(N1, N2):
step1 := 360 / N1
step2 := 360 / N2
shared := lcm(step1, step2) // here 60°
nexus_angles := {k*shared mod 360}
return (joint_cells, nexus_angles)
The sextile nexus set and 60° shared step are explicitly derived from 12-step 30° and 18-step 20°.
11.2.3.2 SextileRouter on (\mathbb Z_{12}) with backbone constraints
Algorithm 11.43 (SextileRouter12). Input: start index (s\in\mathbb Z_{12}), target index (t\in\mathbb Z_{12}). Output: shortest backbone route using ±2 steps.
function SextileRouter12(s, t):
// Allowed moves are ±2 mod 12
// Solve 2k ≡ (t-s) mod 12
// Reduce by gcd(2,12)=2; reachable iff (t-s) even.
if (t-s) mod 2 != 0: return AMBIG_or_FAIL
k := ((t-s)/2) mod 6
return word of k steps of +2 (or alternative direction by cost)
The allowed sextile move is (s\mapsto s\pm 2\pmod{12}).
11.2.3.3 SemidirectMultiply and transition grammar execution
Algorithm 11.44 (SemidirectMultiply). Inputs: ((e_1,t_1)), ((e_2,t_2)) with action (\varphi:\mathbb Z_3\to \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb Z_4)). Output: product in (\mathbb Z_4\rtimes \mathbb Z_3).
function SemidirectMultiply((e1,t1),(e2,t2),phi):
e := e1 + phi(t1)(e2) mod 4
t := t1 + t2 mod 3
return (e,t)
This implements the formal statement “Triangle is the 3 that acts on the 4,” yielding the 12-state archetype wheel.
11.2.3.4 Diagram synthesis for route equivalence and re-locking composites
Algorithm 11.45 (BuildRouteDiagram). Given two routes from the same start to same end expressed in different coordinate systems (e.g., backbone route vs off-grid + re-lock), build a commuting square and evaluate defect.
Steps:
Compile both routes into replay scripts (Chapter 5).
Evaluate both actions on a pinned test set of latent states consistent with declared regions.
Measure diagram defect and emit:
diagram witness if within tolerance,
conflict packet if a lower bound violates tolerance,
AMBIG evidence plan if missing bounds.
11.2.4 Certificates
11.2.4.1 Semidirect engine correctness cert
Certifies:
the action (\varphi:\mathbb Z_3\to\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb Z_4)) is a homomorphism,
the semidirect multiplication law is associative and well-defined,
the engine realizes 12 archetypes as (E\times T\cong 12),
the engine is embedded in circle closure semantics (closure on (S^1)).
11.2.4.2 Nexus intersection cert for the 12/18 handshake
Certifies:
12-grid step 30°, 18-grid step 20°, shared step 60° is minimal,
the nexus set is exactly the 6 points (\theta=60n),
index lockstep update ((k,m)\mapsto(k+2,m+3)).
11.2.4.3 Backbone adjacency compliance cert
Certifies that a route claimed as “sextile tunneling / backbone routing” uses only ±2 steps in (\mathbb Z_{12}) (and corresponding ±3 steps in (\mathbb Z_{18}) when applicable), and that any off-grid move includes explicit re-locking operations as required by corridor.
11.2.4.4 Holonomy boundedness cert for multi-coordinate loops
Certifies that pinned loop families in the combined routing system have bounded holonomy defect, and that any nonzero holonomy is either:
declared as a physical effect under corridor, or
quarantined as a coherence failure requiring gauge/branch normalization.
11.3 Cloud — Probabilistic metro routing, hidden-state inference, and uncertainty ledgers
11.3.1 Objects
11.3.1.1 Markov metro engines on station graphs
Cloud treats the metro as a stochastic process on stations (or on latent ring state).
Definition 11.46 (Station Markov kernel). A station Markov kernel on station set (\mathcal S) is:[K:\mathcal S\times \mathcal P(\mathcal S)\to[0,1],\quad K(s,\cdot)\ \text{a probability measure},]encoding probabilistic transitions between stations. A deterministic ring translation induces a degenerate kernel (Dirac transitions); noisy routing and uncertain steps induce nontrivial kernels.
11.3.1.2 Observation models: quotient observables and hidden fibers
Cloud formalizes the quotient/fiber viewpoint as a hidden Markov model (HMM).
Definition 11.47 (Hidden fiber model). Let latent state be (u\in\mathbb Z_{M_d}), with observation:[y = \sigma(u)\in\mathbb Z_{15}\quad \text{or}\quad y=(\sigma(u),\tau(u))\in\mathbb Z_{15}\times\mathbb Z_3,]and hidden remainder (q(u)). In snap regimes, the fiber coordinate (q) may be invariant under certain steps, producing strong non-identifiability from station-only observations (Chapter 12 will exploit this).
11.3.1.3 Edge-cost fields and risk metrics for routing under uncertainty
Cloud routing attaches stochastic costs to edges:
expected number of steps,
probability of leaving a corridor,
probability of violating admissibility,
expected defect accumulation.
Risk metrics are stored as vectors and integrated into corridor truth (Chapter 4). Uncertainty must be explicit: any route chosen under uncertainty must produce a CandidateSet and EvidencePlan when uniqueness is not certified.
11.3.1.4 Uncertainty ledger schema for metro inference
A metro inference ledger records:
posterior over current station and fiber classes,
estimated step parameter distributions,
identifiability flags (alias cones induced by quotienting),
mixing and dependence diagnostics if samples arise from Markov chains,
replay determinism and randomness pinning (Chapter 5).
11.3.2 Calculus
11.3.2.1 Mixing, stationarity, and entropy monotones on metro graphs
For stochastic metro engines, stationarity and mixing govern the validity of long-run claims.
Key objects:
stationary distribution (\pi) satisfying (\pi K=\pi),
mixing bounds in total variation or spectral gap,
entropy production when reversible.
Corridors requiring inference from long runs must demand mixing certificates; otherwise verdicts remain NEAR/AMBIG (Chapter 4).
11.3.2.2 Conditioning as corridor restriction via nexus seams
Observing that the system is at a nexus seam (e.g., sextile boundary) conditions the state and restricts admissible transitions.
Conditioning is treated as a domain restriction:[\mu(\cdot \mid \text{nexus}) \quad \text{is valid only if}\ \mu(\text{nexus})>0,]and must be recorded as an assumption in the ledger.
11.3.2.3 Data-processing boundaries: quotient projection loses fiber information
The projection (u\mapsto \sigma(u)) is non-invertible. Therefore:
distinct fiber states (q) map to the same station,
identifiability of (q) from (\sigma)-only observations is generally impossible without extra observables.
This is encoded as an identifiability ridge: if the observation model depends only on (\sigma), the posterior over (q) cannot collapse beyond what corridor permits, and must remain set-valued unless additional information is introduced.
11.3.2.4 Composition of uncertainty across routing pipelines
Uncertainty propagation follows corridor-pinned bound algebra:
distortion constants (when moving between coordinate systems),
estimator errors (for inferred step sizes),
mixing errors (for dependent samples),combined into end-to-end bounds. Missing terms force AMBIG.
11.3.3 Algorithms
11.3.3.1 Random-walk simulation on a station Cayley graph
Simulate a stochastic metro process with pinned randomness:
sample step choice (s) from a pinned distribution over StepSet,
update station by induced rule,
record trajectory and ledger.
Deterministic replay requires pinned PRNG and stream schedule (Chapter 5).
11.3.3.2 HMM filtering for fiber remainder classes
Filter the hidden remainder (q) given observed station sequence (\sigma_t):
prediction step uses latent dynamics on (\mathbb Z_{M_d}),
update step uses observation likelihood (p(\sigma_t\mid u_t)) induced by (\sigma(u)),
produce posterior over residue classes (q\bmod 3^k) at coarse levels when full (q) is too large.
Filtering output must be represented as a CandidateSet/uncertainty ledger when uniqueness cannot be certified.
11.3.3.3 Step-parameter inference from observed station increments
Infer step parameter (R) (or class of (R)) from observed (\Delta\sigma) patterns.
On the 45 shadow, when (R\equiv 0\pmod 3), the station increment is (\Delta\sigma=R/3\pmod{15}).Therefore, observing station increments yields modular constraints on (R), and uncertainty remains when multiple (R) satisfy the same modular increment. Output must be AMBIG with candidate (R)-classes unless additional evidence is available.
11.3.3.4 Stochastic route planner with evidence plans
Compute a route that minimizes expected cost under uncertainty:
produce candidate routes on the station graph,
evaluate expected costs under posterior over parameters,
if multiple routes are near-optimal within uncertainty, output CandidateSet and EvidencePlan to disambiguate (e.g., request additional observations at nexus seams).
11.3.4 Certificates
11.3.4.1 Mass preservation and kernel validity certs
Certify that (K(s,\cdot)) is a probability distribution for all (s), and that total mass is preserved across steps. For deterministic induced kernels, certify that transitions are well-defined and admissible.
11.3.4.2 Mixing-rate and dependence certs
Certify mixing bounds (spectral gap, coupling, or empirical bounds permitted by corridor). If mixing cannot be certified, long-run statistical claims must be downgraded.
11.3.4.3 Identifiability/ambiguity certs for quotient observations
Certify either:
identifiability of hidden parameters given observation model and extra observables, or
intrinsic ambiguity, expressed as equivalence classes (fiber classes), with explicit evidence plan to reduce ambiguity if possible.
11.3.4.4 Replay determinism certs for probabilistic metro computations
Certify pinned PRNG, pinned random stream schedule, transcript hashing, and reproducibility of outputs. Any unpinned randomness invalidates OK sealing under strict corridors.
11.4 Fractal — Octave ladders, refinement towers, and multiscale metro routing
11.4.1 Objects
11.4.1.1 Octave graph objects and circle scaling
Fractal metro engines are indexed by octave depth.
Definition 11.48 (Circle scaling). Circle scaling is defined as:[C_n = 360\cdot 3^n,]so octave lifting multiplies the phase length by 3 and the circle is base-3 in the octave sense.
This defines an octave graph whose nodes are circles of length (C_n) (or their discretizations), with edges corresponding to octave lifts.
11.4.1.2 Refined modulus ladder (M_d) and digit decomposition
The refined metro ladder is:[M_d = 15\cdot 3^{d+4},]with decomposition (u=\sigma\cdot 3^{d+4}+q).
This yields a multiresolution digit hierarchy:
coarse digit: (\sigma\in\mathbb Z_{15}),
fine remainder: (q\in\mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}}),with the observable at a given resolution determined by which digits are included in the decode.
11.4.1.3 Scaling-as-conjugacy: multiplicative scaling vs additive stepping
The refined system admits multiple charts:
multiplicative scaling: (u\mapsto 3^n u \pmod{M_d}),
additive stepping: (u\mapsto u+3^{n+5}\pmod{M_d}).
The chart rotation “multiply becomes add” is explicitly used to explain fiber freezing and snap regimes; the additive chart makes digit-freeze conditions explicit as divisibility of the step by powers of 3.
11.4.1.4 Multiscale routing objects: skeleton, fibers, and seed compression
Fractal routing treats:
the station ring as a coarse skeleton,
the remainder digits as fibers,
route words as multiscale objects that must propagate admissibility and invariants across refinement.
Routes are stored as seeds with:
coarse route on (\sigma),
fiber constraints (if required),
propagation bounds and budgets,
replay commitments (Chapters 4–5).
11.4.2 Calculus
11.4.2.1 Step scaling and the phase-quantization origin of the metro
The metro step is a quantized boundary phase increment:[u=\lfloor 45\psi\rfloor,\quad u\mapsto u+R\pmod{45}]so octave scaling changes the step size and induces the observed corridor decompositions.
11.4.2.2 Freeze ladder and snap collapse in the refined modulus
The refined calculus predicts a digit-freeze ladder as (n) increases.
Rule 11.49 (Freeze progression). In the refined system (M_d=15\cdot 3^{d+4}) with step (s=3^{n+5}), the conserved remainder grows with (n); in particular, (u\bmod 3^{n+5}) is frozen, so increasing (n) freezes more low-level digits.
Rule 11.50 (Snap collapse). At (n=d), the orbit collapses to a pure 5-cycle and the full remainder (q(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}) becomes invariant under the step; the dynamics changes only the coarse station digit (\sigma).
11.4.2.3 Twist defects: noncommutation of scale change and station projection
Define the twist defect between coarse projection and scale lifts:[\Delta_{\mathrm{twist}} := \sup_{u\in S} d\big(\sigma(R(u)),\ \widetilde R(\sigma(u))\big),]where (R) is a scale lift on (u) and (\widetilde R) is the induced coarse map on (\sigma) when it exists. Twist defects quantify whether a coarse station model is stable under refinement and are required to be bounded to promote multiscale routing claims.
11.4.2.4 Tightening schedules and budget closure for deep routing
Fractal corridors require:
tightening of tolerances with refinement depth,
explicit propagation of defect bounds across scales,
bounded loop enumeration and recursion budgets,
AMBIG evidence plans when bounds are missing.
No multiscale route may be sealed at L3 unless all cross-scale obligations close under the corridor truth lattice (Chapter 4).
11.4.3 Algorithms

Chapter 12 — Holographic Refinement: Quotient/Fiber Decompositions (Addr ⟨0023⟩₄)
12.1 Square — Refined grids, digit splits ((\sigma,q)), and observability levels
12.1.1 Objects
12.1.1.1 Refined circle grids ( \mathbb Z_{M_d} ) and refinement depth (d)
A holographic refinement is a family of finite cyclic carriers whose moduli grow by powers of (3) while preserving a fixed coarse station alphabet of size (15).
Definition 12.1 (Refinement modulus). For refinement depth (d\in\mathbb Z_{\ge 3}), define the refined circle grid[M_d := 15\cdot 3^{d+4} = 5\cdot 3^{d+5},]and take the refined carrier to be the residue ring[U_d := \mathbb Z_{M_d}.]
Definition 12.2 (Refined latent state). A refined latent state is an element (u\in U_d). All observable “stations” and all hidden “microstates” are defined as deterministic decoders of (u).
Definition 12.3 (Microstate multiplicity per station). The carrier (U_d) contains (15) macro-classes of size (3^{d+4}); this is the structural statement that each station carries an exponentially growing internal microstate capacity as (d) increases.
12.1.1.2 Quotient/fiber decode maps and digit towers
Holographic refinement is defined by a canonical digit split into a coarse quotient digit (\sigma) and a fine remainder (q).
Definition 12.4 (Station digit). Define the coarse station digit map[\sigma_d(u) := \left\lfloor \frac{u}{3^{d+4}} \right\rfloor \in {0,\dots,14}\cong \mathbb Z_{15}.]
Definition 12.5 (Fiber remainder). Define the internal remainder (the “fiber coordinate”)[q_d(u) := u \bmod 3^{d+4} \in \mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}}.]
Definition 12.6 (Reconstruction). Every (u\in{0,\dots,M_d-1}) admits a unique decomposition[u = \sigma_d(u)\cdot 3^{d+4} + q_d(u),]and the pair ((\sigma_d,q_d)) is therefore a complete coordinate system for the refined carrier.
Definition 12.7 (Digit tower and partial observation). For (k\in{0,1,\dots,d+4}), define the truncated remainder[q_{d,k}(u) := u \bmod 3^{k}\in \mathbb Z_{3^{k}},]and the corresponding observability operator[\mathcal O_{d,k}(u) := \big(\sigma_d(u),\ q_{d,k}(u)\big).]The family ({\mathcal O_{d,k}}_k) is a filtration of observations: increasing (k) increases visible resolution of the fiber.
12.1.1.3 Step parameters, octave index (n), and the refined u-automaton
Refined dynamics are defined by a deterministic automaton acting on (U_d) by modular translation with a stride that is a pure power of 3.
Definition 12.8 (Refined spin-step). Fix an integer index (n\in\mathbb Z). Define the stride[s(n) := 3^{n+5},]and define the u-automaton step[u \mapsto u' := u + s(n) \pmod{M_d}.]
The index (n) determines the “octave” of the step; the refinement depth (d) determines the station divisor (3^{d+4}) used by (\sigma_d) and (q_d).
Definition 12.9 (Snap octave). The snap octave is the regime (n=d), so the stride becomes[s(d) = 3^{d+5}.]
12.1.1.4 Observability levels and certified “holographic” appearance
The holographic effect is the dependence of observed dynamics on which digits are visible.
Definition 12.10 (Observation classes).
Macro observer: sees only (\sigma_d(u)).
Macro+triangle observer: sees ((\sigma_d(u),u\bmod 3)) (when defined as a coarse subphase).
Partial fiber observer (depth (k)): sees (\mathcal O_{d,k}(u)=(\sigma_d(u),q_{d,k}(u))).
Full refined observer: sees ((\sigma_d(u),q_d(u))), equivalent to (u).
Definition 12.11 (Holographic appearance). A refined step is holographically invisible at resolution (k) if (\mathcal O_{d,k}(u')=\mathcal O_{d,k}(u)) for all (u) in the declared region; it is holographically visible at macro scale if (\sigma_d(u')\neq \sigma_d(u)) along the orbit. Snap tunneling is the extreme case in which (\sigma_d) changes while (q_d) remains invariant.
12.1.2 Calculus
12.1.2.1 Orbit length and cycle stratification ((d,n)\mapsto L(d,n))
The orbit structure of (u\mapsto u+s(n)) is determined by (\gcd(M_d,s(n))).
Proposition 12.12 (GCD law and orbit length). Let (M_d=15\cdot 3^{d+4}) and (s(n)=3^{n+5}). Then[\gcd(M_d,s(n)) = 3^{\min(d+5,n+5)},]and the orbit length is[L(d,n)=\frac{M_d}{\gcd(M_d,s(n))}=\begin{cases}5\cdot 3^{d-n} & n\le d,\5 & n\ge d.\end{cases}]
Definition 12.13 (Regime classification).
Drift regime: (n\ll d), long orbits (L(d,n)) with limited digit freezing.
Pre-snap regime: (n=d-1), orbit length (L(d,d-1)=15).
Snap regime: (n=d), orbit length (L(d,d)=5).
Post-snap regime: (n>d), orbit length remains (5) (saturated by the maximal 3-power in (M_d)).
12.1.2.2 Quotient update (\sigma_d) and remainder update (q_d) under additive stepping
The digit split yields explicit update rules when the stride is divisible by appropriate powers of 3.
Lemma 12.14 (Remainder freezing condition). Under the step (u' = u + 3^{n+5}\pmod{M_d}), the full remainder (q_d(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}) is invariant if and only if[3^{n+5}\equiv 0 \pmod{3^{d+4}}\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quadn\ge d-1.]
Thus for (n\ge d-1),[q_d(u')=q_d(u).]
Lemma 12.15 (Quotient advance in the frozen-fiber regime). If (n\ge d-1) so that (q_d) is invariant, then[\sigma_d(u') \equiv \sigma_d(u) + \frac{3^{n+5}}{3^{d+4}}\pmod{15}= \sigma_d(u) + 3^{n-d+1}\pmod{15},]since adding a multiple of (3^{d+4}) changes only the quotient digit in the decomposition (u=\sigma_d\cdot 3^{d+4}+q_d).
In particular:
at (n=d-1): (\sigma_d\mapsto \sigma_d+1\pmod{15}) (15-cycle),
at (n=d): (\sigma_d\mapsto \sigma_d+3\pmod{15}) (5-cycle),and at snap this update is explicit: (\sigma(u_{t+1})\equiv \sigma(u_t)+3\pmod{15}).
12.1.2.3 Partial-freeze regime and frozen-digit depth
For (n<d-1), the full remainder (q_d) is not invariant. Nevertheless, a lower digit block is invariant because the stride is a power of 3.
Proposition 12.16 (Frozen digit depth). Let (s(n)=3^{n+5}). Then for any (u),[u' \equiv u \pmod{3^{n+5}},]hence[q_{d,n+5}(u') = q_{d,n+5}(u).]Therefore, in the partial-freeze regime, the lowest (n+5) base-3 digits of (u) are invariant, while higher digits may drift.
This is the formal meaning of the “partial-freeze” structure described in the refined u-automaton analysis: increments by (3^{n+5}) leave (u\bmod 3^{n+5}) unchanged while allowing higher remainder levels to change.
Corollary 12.17 (Station drift under partial freeze). When (n<d-1), the quotient digit (\sigma_d) depends on carries from the drifting higher remainder digits. Consequently, the macro station dynamics may exhibit slow drift or longer cycle lengths (as quantified by (L(d,n))) while a lower-resolution observer (\mathcal O_{d,k}) with (k\le n+5) observes no change in the corresponding fiber digits.
12.1.2.4 Observability filtration and admissible inference boundaries
The observation maps (\mathcal O_{d,k}) define a filtration of information. Corridor truth requires that inference never exceeds observability.
Rule 12.18 (Observability discipline). Any claim about fiber coordinates beyond the observed (q_{d,k}) is inadmissible unless supported by:
additional observations,
a certified invertibility/identifiability theorem, or
an explicit model assumption recorded as a corridor obligation.Absent such support, the correct outcome is AMBIG with a CandidateSet over fiber completions.
Definition 12.19 (Holographic indistinguishability class). For fixed ((d,k)), define the equivalence relation[u\sim_{d,k} v \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \mathcal O_{d,k}(u)=\mathcal O_{d,k}(v).]Then (\sim_{d,k}) partitions (U_d) into indistinguishability fibers of size (3^{d+4-k}). Partial-freeze regimes enlarge these indistinguishability classes dynamically by preserving low digits.
12.1.3 Algorithms
12.1.3.1 Encode/decode algorithms for ((\sigma_d,q_d)) and truncated fibers
Algorithm 12.20 (DecodeSigmaQ). Input: (u\in{0,\dots,M_d-1}). Output: (\sigma_d(u)\in\mathbb Z_{15}), (q_d(u)\in\mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}}).[\sigma_d(u)=\left\lfloor u/3^{d+4}\right\rfloor,\qquad q_d(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}.]
Algorithm 12.21 (EncodeFromSigmaQ). Input: (\sigma\in{0,\dots,14}), (q\in{0,\dots,3^{d+4}-1}). Output: (u=\sigma\cdot 3^{d+4}+q\in{0,\dots,M_d-1}).
Algorithm 12.22 (TruncatedObservation). Input: (u), truncation (k\le d+4). Output: (\mathcal O_{d,k}(u)=(\sigma_d(u),u\bmod 3^k)).
All decoders must be evaluated on canonical representatives (u\in[0,M_d-1]); this is a mandatory normal form for floor-based quotient extraction.
12.1.3.2 Compute orbit length, station increment, and frozen-digit depth
Algorithm 12.23 (ComputeRegimeInvariants). Inputs: (d,n). Outputs: (M_d), stride (s=3^{n+5}), orbit length (L(d,n)), frozen depth (k_{\mathrm{freeze}}=n+5), and (if (n\ge d-1)) station increment (\Delta\sigma = 3^{n-d+1}\bmod 15).
Implementation:
(M_d=15\cdot 3^{d+4}).
(s=3^{n+5}).
(L(d,n)) by the closed form.
frozen digits: (u\bmod 3^{n+5}) invariant (always).
full fiber freeze if (n\ge d-1).
12.1.3.3 Simulate refined u-automaton and emit multi-resolution observables
Algorithm 12.24 (SimulateRefinedStep). Inputs: (d,n,u_0,T). Outputs: orbit ({u_t}{t=0}^{T}) and observable sequences ({\mathcal O{d,k}(u_t)}) for requested (k)-levels.
Update rule:[u_{t+1} = (u_t + 3^{n+5}) \bmod M_d.]
For snap (n=d), the explicit orbit is[u_t \equiv \left(u_0+t\cdot 3^{d+5}\right)\bmod M_d,\quad t=0,\dots,4,]which is a 5-cycle.
The simulator must emit:
verification that the observed orbit length matches (L(d,n)),
verification of frozen digits at each requested observability level,
a residual ledger of any approximations (none are permitted for exact integer dynamics).
12.1.3.4 Compile station routes with fiber constraints
Algorithm 12.25 (CompileSigmaRouteWithFiber). Inputs: (d,n), start ((\sigma_0,q_{d,k,0})), target ((\sigma_1,q_{d,k,1})), observability level (k), corridor policy. Output: either a route witness or AMBIG.
Steps:
Construct the step dynamics on (U_d).
Lift start constraints to a fiber class (F_0={u:\mathcal O_{d,k}(u)=(\sigma_0,q_{d,k,0})}).
Evolve (F_0) under the step map; test whether any element reaches (F_1).
If the mapping is many-to-one at the chosen (k), output CandidateSet of feasible fibers and an evidence plan to refine (k) or add additional observables.
Route compilation is deterministic and must not infer higher fiber digits without certificates.
12.1.4 Certificates
12.1.4.1 Quotient/fiber decomposition correctness cert
Certifies that for the declared modulus (M_d) the pair ((\sigma_d,q_d)) is a valid digit split:
(\sigma_d(u)\in{0,\dots,14}),
(q_d(u)\in\mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}}),
reconstruction (u=\sigma_d 3^{d+4}+q_d) is unique for canonical representatives.

Certifies that:
observation operators (\mathcal O_{d,k}) define a filtration,
any inference beyond (\mathcal O_{d,k}) is flagged as AMBIG unless identifiability certificates exist,
program outputs that depend on hidden digits are either accompanied by certified reconstruction or expressed as CandidateSets with evidence plans (Chapter 4 and Chapter 5).
12.2 Flower — Conjugacy of refinement: multiplicative scaling, additive stepping, and fiber actions
12.2.1 Objects
12.2.1.1 Multiplicative refinement map and its action on (U_d)
Holographic refinement admits a multiplicative representation of scale evolution.
Definition 12.26 (Multiplicative scaling on the u-grid). Define the multiplicative scaling action:[u \mapsto u' \equiv 3^n u \pmod{M_d}.]
This action corresponds to an octave lift on the underlying phase (\psi\mapsto 3^n\psi) and is treated as a Flower-layer symmetry/transport acting on the refined carrier.
12.2.1.2 Induced fiber action (q\mapsto 3^n q) and digit-shift interpretation
The multiplicative action induces a canonical action on the fiber remainder.
Decompose (u=\sigma 3^{d+4}+q). Substituting into the multiplicative map yields:[u' \equiv 3^n(\sigma 3^{d+4}+q)\equiv \sigma 3^{n+d+4}+3^n q \pmod{15\cdot 3^{d+4}}.]
Reducing modulo (3^{d+4}) annihilates the (\sigma)-term, so the induced fiber action is:[q' \equiv 3^n q \pmod{3^{d+4}}.]
Interpretation (digit shift). Multiplication by (3^n) shifts a base-3 expansion upward by (n) digits, annihilating low digits when the modulus has fewer remaining places.
12.2.1.3 Additive spin-step as the conjugate chart (“rotate 90°”)
The refined system uses an additive u-automaton as a conjugate representation of the multiplicative scaling action.
Definition 12.27 (Additive chart). The additive chart is the spin-step map:[u \mapsto u + 3^{n+5}\pmod{M_d}.]
The multiplicative and additive forms are treated as two representations of the same underlying scaling action: “multiply in one chart becomes add in another chart.”
12.2.1.4 Exact sequence viewpoint: quotient (\mathbb Z_{15}) and fiber (\mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}})
The quotient/fiber decomposition is an explicit group extension.
Definition 12.28 (Short exact sequence). The decomposition (u=\sigma 3^{d+4}+q) corresponds to a short exact sequence:[0 \longrightarrow \mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}} \xrightarrow{\iota} \mathbb Z_{M_d} \xrightarrow{\pi} \mathbb Z_{15} \longrightarrow 0,]where (\iota(q)=q) (as the low-digit embedding) and (\pi(u)=\sigma_d(u)) (the station digit map). This expresses precisely that the refined carrier is a bundle over the station ring with fiber (\mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}}).
12.2.2 Calculus
12.2.2.1 Compatibility of multiplicative and additive charts via transported invariants
The two charts are linked by a rotation principle: a change of chart clarifies invariants.
Rule 12.29 (Fiber invariance conditions in each chart).
In multiplicative chart: (q' \equiv 3^n q \pmod{3^{d+4}}); low-digit annihilation occurs as (n) increases.
In additive chart: fiber remainder (q_d(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}) is invariant precisely when the stride is divisible by (3^{d+4}), i.e. (n\ge d-1).
The additive chart makes digit-freeze conditions an exact divisibility statement; the multiplicative chart makes digit-shift and annihilation structure explicit.
12.2.2.2 Commutation obligations: scaling vs quotient projection
The station digit map (\sigma_d) is a quotient projection. Its interaction with scaling is governed by commutation/defect logic.
Definition 12.30 (Scale–projection twist defect). For a scale map (R(u)=3^n u \pmod{M_d}) and the station projection (\sigma_d), define the twist defect on region (S\subseteq U_d) by:[\Delta_{\mathrm{twist}}^{(n)}(S) := \sup_{u\in S} d_{\mathbb Z_{15}}\Big(\sigma_d(R(u)),\ \widetilde R(\sigma_d(u))\Big),]where (\widetilde R) is the induced coarse action on (\mathbb Z_{15}) if it exists under corridor conditions. If (\widetilde R) does not exist or cannot be certified, the correct outcome is AMBIG with evidence plan.
12.2.2.3 Symmetry and holonomy: multi-route refinement coherence
When multiple refinement routes exist (e.g., multiplicative vs additive, or different factorization of scale lifts), coherence requires commuting diagrams and bounded holonomy.
Rule 12.31 (Diagram obligations for chart switches). Any claim that equates additive and multiplicative refinement behavior must provide:
a commuting-square witness between the two induced actions on the observables of interest,
explicit domain/branch declarations for quotient extraction (floor division) and modular reduction,
bounded defect under the chosen corridor.
Nonzero holonomy indicates gauge drift in quotient extraction conventions or an intrinsic obstruction; it must be recorded as a holonomy object and treated by corridor truth policies.
12.2.2.4 Parity channels and refinement invariants
Refinement interacts with Spin-(\chi) (Chapter 9) when digit expansions carry orientation or conjugation.
In particular:
digit shifts under multiplication by (3^n) define parity-like partitions of residue classes,
quotient/fiber splits define “even-channel” coarse invariants (station digit) and “odd-channel” fiber-sensitive microstructure under certain corridors,
parity-aware decomposition can be applied to route equivalence: station-level claims may ignore fiber gauge under specified corridors, while fiber-level claims must respect full digit coherence.
12.2.3 Algorithms
12.2.3.1 Compute induced fiber map in multiplicative chart
Algorithm 12.32 (FiberActionMultiply). Inputs: (d,n,q\in\mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}}). Output: (q'=(3^n q)\bmod 3^{d+4}).
This algorithm is the canonical induced action on the fiber for multiplicative scaling; it is used to predict digit annihilation and to build commutation tests against additive stepping.
12.2.3.2 Check chart-equivalence of refinement actions on observables
Algorithm 12.33 (CheckChartEquivalenceOnObservables). Inputs: (d,n), chosen observability (\mathcal O_{d,k}), test set (S\subseteq U_d). Outputs: defect bounds comparing:
multiplicative update (u\mapsto 3^n u),
additive update (u\mapsto u+3^{n+5}),after passing through (\mathcal O_{d,k}).
Steps:
For each (u\in S), compute:[y_{\times} := \mathcal O_{d,k}(3^n u \bmod M_d),\quad y_{+} := \mathcal O_{d,k}(u+3^{n+5}\bmod M_d).]
Measure defect (d(y_\times,y_+)) in a pinned metric on the observation space.
Emit:
OK if defect is exactly 0 on (S),
NEAR if defect is bounded within tolerance,
AMBIG if admissibility/branch constraints prevent evaluation.
12.2.3.3 Compute twist defects and induced coarse actions
Algorithm 12.34 (ComputeTwistAndCoarseAction). Inputs: (d,n), projection (\sigma_d). Outputs: induced coarse map (\widetilde R) if definable, and twist defect bound.
Steps:
Attempt to infer (\widetilde R) as a function (\mathbb Z_{15}\to\mathbb Z_{15}) by evaluating (\sigma_d(3^n u)) on a pinned representative set of (u) for each station class.
If the result depends on fiber (q), (\widetilde R) is not well-defined; output AMBIG and provide an evidence plan specifying which additional observables (partial digits) are required to define a fiber-refined coarse action.
If well-defined, compute twist defect and certify within corridor tolerances.
12.2.3.4 Canonicalize refinement routes and emit diagram witnesses
Algorithm 12.35 (CanonicalizeRefinementRoutes). Inputs: set of refinement routes between the same observable endpoints, corridor policy. Output: canonical route and diagram witnesses.
Procedure:
Use invariant gates (station/fiber invariants) to filter candidates.
Compute commutation defects between alternative route compositions.
Select canonical route by minimal certified defect and deterministic tie-break rules.
Emit commuting diagram witnesses and holonomy records where loops exist.
12.2.4 Certificates
12.2.4.1 Multiplicative-to-fiber action correctness cert
Certifies the derived fiber action (q'\equiv 3^n q\pmod{3^{d+4}}) from the decomposition (u=\sigma 3^{d+4}+q) and the multiplicative update (u'\equiv 3^n u\pmod{M_d}).
12.2.4.2 Additive chart fiber-freeze cert
Certifies the divisibility condition for full remainder invariance under additive stepping:[3^{n+5}\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 3^{d+4}) \iff n\ge d-1,]and records the induced station-step behavior in the frozen-fiber regime.
12.2.4.3 Twist/commutation certs for scale vs projection
Certifies bounded twist defects for scale maps and station projection, or produces obstruction/ambiguity artifacts:
commuting-square witnesses when (\widetilde R) exists,
ambiguity certificates when (\sigma_d) alone is insufficient (fiber dependence),
explicit evidence plans to refine observability.
12.2.4.4 Holonomy and gauge coherence certs for refinement route cycles
Certifies that refinement route cycles (mixing multiplicative and additive charts, or multiple factorizations) have bounded holonomy under pinned quotient extraction conventions. Failures produce quarantined holonomy records and block OK sealing for claims relying on global coherence.
12.3 Cloud — Observability, hidden fibers, and inference under partial refinement
12.3.1 Objects
12.3.1.1 Observation models for quotient/fiber systems
Cloud treats ((\sigma_d,q_{d,k})) as an observation of a latent state (u).
Definition 12.36 (Observation channel). For fixed ((d,k)), define the deterministic observation map:[Y_t := \mathcal O_{d,k}(u_t),]and, when noise is present, define a stochastic channel:[\mathbb P(Y_t=y\mid u_t=u) = \Lambda_{d,k}(y\mid u),]where (\Lambda_{d,k}) is pinned by corridor (identity channel for noiseless observation).
12.3.1.2 Hidden Markov structures induced by step uncertainty
When the step index (n) or the stride is uncertain, the system becomes a hidden Markov model with latent parameters.
Definition 12.37 (Latent parameter). Let (\theta) encode the stride regime (e.g., (n), or a distribution over step-set choices). The latent dynamics are:[u_{t+1} = u_t + s(\theta)\pmod{M_d},]or a mixture over strides. Observations are (Y_t=\mathcal O_{d,k}(u_t)). Identifiability of (\theta) depends strongly on which digits are observed.
12.3.1.3 Indistinguishability fibers and alias cones
Observation induces equivalence classes (u\sim_{d,k}v). These classes define intrinsic ambiguity.
Definition 12.38 (Alias cone for hidden fiber). The set of latent states consistent with an observation sequence ({Y_t}{t=0}^T) is:[\mathcal A := {u_0\in U_d:\ \mathcal O{d,k}(u_t)=Y_t\ \forall t,\ \text{under the pinned dynamics}}.]If (\mathcal A) has multiple elements or multiple residue classes, inference must return CandidateSets rather than a unique latent reconstruction.
12.3.1.4 Uncertainty ledgers for observability-limited claims
Any inference in this chapter is governed by the corridor truth lattice; uncertainty is recorded in ledgers:
posterior distributions over (u_0) or (q),
ambiguity over (n),
confidence bounds if stochastic evidence used,
evidence plans for resolving ambiguity by increasing (k) or adding observations (nexus conditions, auxiliary readouts).
12.3.2 Calculus
12.3.2.1 Data processing and information loss under projection
Projection (u\mapsto \sigma_d(u)) is many-to-one. Therefore, recovering (q_d(u)) from (\sigma_d(u)) alone is generally impossible without additional assumptions; this is treated as an identifiability boundary. Claims that violate this boundary are compile-time no-go (Chapter 10) unless they are explicitly set-valued.
12.3.2.2 Partial-freeze amplifies observational aliasing
If (u\bmod 3^{n+5}) is invariant under the dynamics, then any observation (\mathcal O_{d,k}) with (k\le n+5) yields a constant fiber readout; the dynamics become unobservable at that resolution in the fiber channel. Consequently, the inference problem for hidden digits above (k) becomes strictly underdetermined, and CandidateSets are mandatory.
12.3.2.3 Conditioning on events as corridor restrictions
In metro systems, special observations (e.g., “nexus seam” events) condition the latent state and can reduce ambiguity. Such conditioning is treated as a corridor restriction: it is admissible only if the conditioned event has positive probability under the pinned model and is explicitly recorded as an assumption in the ledger.
12.3.2.4 Propagation of uncertainty across refinement and chart changes
When inference relies on transforming between charts (multiplicative vs additive) or between observation levels (k\to k'), uncertainty must propagate through the transformation with pinned distortion bounds. Missing distortion bounds force AMBIG.
12.3.3 Algorithms
12.3.3.1 Filtering fiber digits under (\mathcal O_{d,k})
Algorithm 12.39 (FiberFilter). Inputs: (d,k), observation sequence ({Y_t}), pinned dynamics. Output: posterior over (q_{d,k}(u_t)) and CandidateSet over completions in (q_d(u_t)).
The filter:
enumerates or samples latent fibers consistent with (Y_0),
propagates them under the step dynamics,
intersects with observation constraints at each time,
returns the remaining equivalence classes and an evidence plan if the candidate set is large.
12.3.3.2 Infer freeze depth from observed invariances
Algorithm 12.40 (InferFreezeDepth). Inputs: observed stability of (q_{d,k}) over time, stride model. Output: constraints on (n).
If (q_{d,k}) is observed constant for all (t) and the dynamics is known to be additive stepping by (3^{n+5}), then (k\le n+5) is consistent with partial freeze. This yields a lower bound on (n) and a CandidateSet of feasible (n) values unless additional observables distinguish them.
12.3.3.3 Evidence plan synthesis: which observability upgrade resolves ambiguity
Algorithm 12.41 (PlanObservabilityUpgrade). Inputs: current ambiguity class size, desired uniqueness outcome, budget. Output: minimal (k') and additional observation requirements.
The plan may propose:
increasing (k) (observe more digits),
observing additional derived observables (e.g., parity channels, commuting-square tests),
adding constraints on (u_0) (prior fiber restrictions),to reduce CandidateSets and permit NEAR/OK promotion under corridor.
12.3.3.4 Robust inference under noisy observations
When observations are noisy, robust estimators and confidence enclosures are used to maintain corridor correctness. The algorithm must pin randomness and provide concentration bounds; otherwise outputs remain AMBIG.
12.3.4 Certificates
12.3.4.1 Identifiability/ambiguity certificates for fiber reconstruction
Certifies either:
identifiability of fiber digits and/or stride parameter under the observation model, or
intrinsic ambiguity expressed as equivalence classes, with a finite evidence plan for refinement.
12.3.4.2 Confidence and tail-regime certificates (when stochastic)
Certifies:
estimator validity under pinned tail regime and dependence assumptions,
confidence bounds for inferred quantities,
compatibility with corridor truth mapping (NEAR discipline).
12.3.4.3 Uncertainty propagation certificates across chart changes
Certifies that uncertainty bounds remain valid when mapping between multiplicative and additive charts or between observability levels, including any distortion constants used.
12.3.4.4 Replay determinism certificates for inference pipelines
Certifies:
determinism of filtering and candidate enumeration under pinned tie-break rules,
determinism of any allowed randomness under pinned PRNG and stream schedule,
transcript hash stability and reproducibility.
12.4 Fractal — Refinement towers, multiresolution grids, and seed compression of observability
12.4.1 Objects
12.4.1.1 Refinement ladders and refinement injection operators
Fractal refinement treats (d) as a scale index and builds a ladder of refined carriers ({U_d}).
Definition 12.42/compiler (Refinement ladder). The refinement ladder is the family:[{U_d=\mathbb Z_{15\cdot 3^{d+4}}}_{d\ge 3},]with scale transitions (d\to d+1) increasing fiber resolution by a factor of 3.
Definition 12.43 (General refinement injection). A refinement injection is a map that embeds a coarse coordinate system into a finer one by expanding each cell into a fixed micro-tile. In the manuscript’s canonical base-4 holographic levels, the refinement injection is:[\kappa((i,j),(a,b)) := (4i+a,\ 4j+b),]mapping a coarse cell to a micro-cell in the refined grid.
This operator is the abstract refinement archetype; the metro refinement ladder is its base-3 analog in one dimension (digit refinement in (\mathbb Z_{3^k})).
12.4.1.2 Observability filtrations as multiresolution structure
The family ({\mathcal O_{d,k}}_k) defines a multiresolution structure inside a fixed (d). The family ({(d,k)}) defines a two-parameter refinement: deepen the carrier (increase (d)) and deepen observation (increase (k)). This structure is a filtration and is the basis of “holographic” storage: coarse station semantics remain constant while fiber resolution grows.
12.4.1.3 Partial-view operators and “corner views”
A partial view operator extracts a subset of a full refined level and is treated as a quotient observation rather than a new level. In the manuscript’s canonical holographic system, quadrant projections formalize partial views within a full level (e.g., treating 8×8 as a quadrant view of a 16×16 level).Metro observability levels are the base-3 analog: observing (q_{d,k}) is a partial view of the full fiber (q_d).
12.4.1.4 Seed objects for refinement towers
A refinement tower is stored as seeds and modules:
a seed for each ((d,n)) regime capturing stride, orbit length, and freeze properties,
a seed for each observability level (k) capturing indistinguishability classes and inference boundaries,
module seals linking these seeds to the MyceliumGraph (Chapter 5) for deterministic expansion and routing.
12.4.2 Calculus
12.4.2.1 Tightening schedules across (d) and across (k)
As (d) increases, the fiber grows; as (k) increases, observation refines. Corridors must pin tightening schedules that specify:
which claims are invariant across (d) (station-level claims),
which claims require increasing (k) to maintain identifiability,
which defect bounds tighten when moving to finer (d) or higher (k).
No multiscale claim may be promoted to OK without satisfying the tightening schedule and the associated closure obligations (Chapter 4).
12.4.2.2 Drift vs snap as a multiresolution phenomenon
The orbit length (L(d,n)) decreases as (n) approaches (d).This is a multiresolution effect:
at low (n), many digits participate and the orbit is long,
as (n) increases, more low digits freeze (partial-freeze),
at (n\ge d-1), the full remainder at station resolution is frozen,
at (n=d), the orbit collapses to a 5-cycle with station digit stepping by +3 and fiber fully invariant.
Thus “tunneling” is an extreme endpoint of a refinement ladder of freezing: progressively more of the fiber becomes invariant until only the coarse digit moves.
12.4.2.3 Fractal equivalence: when coarse station models are stable across refinement
A coarse station model (a dynamics defined solely on (\sigma_d)) is stable across refinement if:
the induced station update is well-defined independent of fiber (q_d),
twist defects between coarse projection and refined dynamics are bounded under corridor.
If the station update depends on fiber, the coarse model is intrinsically ambiguous and must be treated as an HMM with hidden fiber; any attempt to treat it as deterministic on (\sigma) alone is a compile-time no-go under strict corridors.
12.4.2.4 Safety against recursive explosion in refinement/inference loops
Refinement introduces exponential state growth; therefore all refinement and inference procedures must be budgeted:
maximum (d) explored,
maximum (k) observed,
maximum candidate fiber classes retained,
bounded loop enumeration for holonomy and twist diagnostics.
When budgets are exceeded, the correct output is AMBIG with a finite evidence plan rather than partial, unsealed conclusions.
12.4.3 Algorithms
12.4.3.1 Build refinement towers and observability filtrations
Algorithm 12.44 (BuildRefinementTower). Inputs: (d_{\min},d_{\max}). Output: for each (d), modulus (M_d), decoders ((\sigma_d,q_d)), and the observability operators (\mathcal O_{d,k}) for (k=0,\dots,d+4).
This algorithm emits canonical normal forms for all maps and attaches obligations for any floor-division conventions.
12.4.3.2 Cross-scale consistency checks for decoded stations
Algorithm 12.45 (CrossScaleStationConsistency). For a fixed latent integer representative (u), compute (\sigma_d(u)) at multiple (d) and verify consistency where appropriate (e.g., when embedding (u) across moduli under a pinned injection). Emit twist diagnostics when station labels change unexpectedly across refinement due to inconsistent representative selection or decode conventions.
12.4.3.3 Seed compression of refinement properties: freeze ladders and snap tables
Algorithm 12.46 (CompressFreezeLadderToSeed). Inputs: fixed (d), range of (n), computed properties:
(L(d,n)),
frozen depth (n+5),
full-freeze threshold (n\ge d-1),
snap threshold (n=d),
induced station increments in frozen regimes.Outputs: a seed that regenerates these properties and their certificates deterministically.
Key facts to encode include the exact formulas and divisibility conditions.
12.4.3.4 Multiscale evidence planning: minimal (k) required to see the effect
Algorithm 12.47 (PlanMinimalObservabilityForEffect). Inputs: target effect class (detect station movement; detect fiber change; detect step exponent), current ((d,k)), corridor budget. Output: recommended (k') and additional observables needed.
The planner computes:
which digits are frozen under candidate (n),
whether the effect is invisible at current (k),
the minimal (k') that intersects the moving digit block,and outputs an evidence plan that is admissible and terminating under corridor budgets.
12.4.4 Certificates
12.4.4.1 Refinement tower coherence cert
Certifies that:
moduli (M_d) are correctly defined,
decoders (\sigma_d,q_d) are well-defined and canonical,
scale transitions preserve decode conventions and do not introduce ambiguity without explicit declaration.
12.4.4.2 Freeze ladder and snap correctness cert
Certifies:
orbit length formula (L(d,n)),
full-freeze condition (n\ge d-1),
snap orbit length (5) at (n=d),
snap station update and fiber invariance: (\sigma\mapsto\sigma+3) and (q) fixed.
12.4.4.3 Multiresolution observability certs
Certifies that observability operators (\mathcal O_{d,k}) are consistent partial views of the full refined state and that inference respects observability boundaries (no illicit reconstruction beyond (k) without certificates).
12.4.4.4 Seed integrity certs for refinement modules
Certifies that refinement seeds/modules satisfy:
compression contract (expand → compress idempotence),
replay determinism for all computed tables and routes,
closure of all obligations required for NEAR/OK statuses,
explosion-prevention by enforced budgets and AMBIG evidence-plan outputs.
CHAPTER 12 — HOLOGRAPHIC REFINEMENT: QUOTIENT/FIBER DECOMPOSITIONS (Addr ⟨0023⟩₄)
Chapter 13 — Snap Tunneling Theorem: 5-Cycles and Frozen Remainders (Addr ⟨0030⟩₄)
13.1 Square — Exact snap regime on (U_d=\mathbb Z_{M_d})
13.1.1 Objects
13.1.1.1 Refined modulus, stride, and snap parameterization
Fix an integer refinement depth (d\ge 3). Define the refined circle modulus[M_d := 15\cdot 3^{d+4} = 5\cdot 3^{d+5},]and the refined carrier[U_d := \mathbb Z_{M_d}.]
For an octave index (n\in\mathbb Z), define the stride[s(n):=3^{n+5},]and the u-automaton (spin-step) evolution[u \longmapsto u' := u + s(n)\pmod{M_d}.]
The snap octave is (n=d), hence[s(d)=3^{d+5}.]
A snap instance is the triple ((d,n,u_0)) with (n=d) and initial state (u_0\in U_d).
13.1.1.2 Orbit object and tunnel cycle record
For fixed ((d,n)), define the orbit through (u_0) by:[\mathcal O_{d,n}(u_0) := {u_t}{t\ge 0},\qquad u{t+1}=u_t+s(n)\pmod{M_d}.]At snap ((n=d)), the u-cycle admits an explicit closed form:[u_t = \big(u_0 + t\cdot 3^{d+5}\big)\bmod M_d,\qquad t=0,1,2,3,4.]
A tunnel cycle record is a structured artifact:[\mathcal T_{d}(u_0):=(d,\ M_d,\ s(d),\ u_0,\ {u_t}_{t=0}^4,\ \mathrm{ReplayPtr},\ \mathrm{WitnessPtr}),]whose replay reconstructs the cycle exactly in integer arithmetic.
13.1.1.3 Station digit and hidden remainder decoders
Define the station divisor[D_d := 3^{d+4}.]Define the station digit (macro coordinate):[\sigma(u) := \left\lfloor \frac{u}{3^{d+4}}\right\rfloor \in {0,\dots,14}\cong \mathbb Z_{15}.]
Define the hidden internal remainder (fiber coordinate):[q(u) := u \bmod 3^{d+4} \in \mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}}.]
The map[u \longmapsto (\sigma(u),q(u))]is a complete coordinate split on canonical representatives (u\in{0,\dots,M_d-1}), since[u=\sigma(u)\cdot 3^{d+4}+q(u).]
13.1.1.4 Visible 5-cycle objects and fiber-freeze objects
Define the visible station orbit associated to (u_0) by[\Sigma_t := \sigma(u_t)\in\mathbb Z_{15}.]At snap, the visible station dynamics are a rigid 5-cycle on (\mathbb Z_{15}) generated by (+3) (mod 15).
Define the fiber-freeze predicate:[\mathrm{Freeze}(u_t) := \big(q(u_{t+1})=q(u_t)\big).]At snap, this holds identically on the entire orbit.
A tunnel signature is the pair[\mathrm{TunnelSig}(u_0):=\big({\Sigma_t}_{t=0}^4,\ q(u_0)\big),]which separates visible motion (station cycle) from hidden invariance (frozen remainder).
13.1.2 Calculus
13.1.2.1 Orbit-length theorem and snap collapse
Theorem 13.1 (Snap orbit length). At snap octave (n=d), the u-automaton orbit in (U_d=\mathbb Z_{M_d}) has length exactly (5), for every (d\ge 3).
Proof. With (M_d=5\cdot 3^{d+5}) and (s(d)=3^{d+5}),[\gcd(M_d,s(d))=\gcd(5\cdot 3^{d+5},3^{d+5})=3^{d+5},]hence orbit length[L(d,d)=\frac{M_d}{\gcd(M_d,s(d))}=5.]
A general orbit-length law for (s(n)=3^{n+5}) is:[L(d,n)=\begin{cases}5\cdot 3^{d-n} & n\le d,\5 & n\ge d,\end{cases}]with (\gcd(M_d,s(n))=3^{\min(d+5,n+5)}).
13.1.2.2 Station projection dynamics: (\sigma)-advance and the three 5-cycles
Lemma 13.2 (Station advance at snap). At snap, (\sigma) advances by (+3\pmod{15}) on every step:[\sigma(u_{t+1}) \equiv \sigma(u_t)+3 \pmod{15}.]
Proof. Since (3^{d+5}=3\cdot 3^{d+4}), adding (3^{d+5}) increments the quotient digit by exactly (3) modulo 15, with carries absorbed by reduction modulo (M_d).
Corollary 13.3 (Partition into three disjoint 5-cycles). The map (\sigma\mapsto\sigma+3) partitions (\mathbb Z_{15}) into three disjoint 5-cycles indexed by (\sigma\bmod 3).
Thus the visible tunnel cycles are precisely the cosets of (3\mathbb Z_{15}) under addition.
13.1.2.3 Fiber invariance: frozen remainder and strict invisibility at micro-resolution
Lemma 13.4 (Frozen remainder at snap). At snap octave (n=d),[q(u_{t+1}) = q(u_t)\quad \forall t.]
Proof. Since (s(d)=3^{d+5}=3\cdot 3^{d+4}) is a multiple of (3^{d+4}), adding (s(d)) leaves (u\bmod 3^{d+4}) unchanged.
Definition 13.5 (Micro-invisibility). For any observation operator that depends only on the fiber coordinate (q(u)), the snap dynamics are observationally stationary:[q(u_t)\equiv q(u_0)\quad\Rightarrow\quad \mathcal O(q(u_t))=\mathcal O(q(u_0))\ \ \forall t.]Thus, the snap tunnel is visible in (\sigma) while invisible in (q).
13.1.2.4 Snap Tunneling Theorem as a quotient-action with frozen fiber
Theorem 13.6 (Snap Tunneling Theorem). Fix (d\ge 3). Let (U_d=\mathbb Z_{M_d}) with (M_d=15\cdot 3^{d+4}), and define snap stride (s=3^{d+5}). Under the evolution[u_{t+1}=u_t+s\pmod{M_d},]the following hold for every (u_0\in U_d):
Exact 5-cycle: the orbit length is (5).
Visible station 5-cycle: the quotient coordinate (\sigma(u)=\lfloor u/3^{d+4}\rfloor\in\mathbb Z_{15}) evolves by (\sigma\mapsto\sigma+3), hence cycles through a 5-cycle in (\mathbb Z_{15}).
Frozen fiber: the remainder (q(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}) is invariant along the orbit.
Equivalently, under the identification (u\leftrightarrow (\sigma,q)), the snap step is the product action:[(\sigma,q)\longmapsto (\sigma+3 \bmod 15,\ q).]This is a quotient translation on the station ring with trivial action on the fiber.
13.1.3 Algorithms
13.1.3.1 Compute the explicit u-level 5-cycle at snap
Algorithm 13.7 (SnapCycleU). Inputs: (d\ge 3), (u_0\in{0,\dots,M_d-1}). Outputs: (u_0,\dots,u_4).
function SnapCycleU(d, u0):
Md := 15 * 3^(d+4)
s := 3^(d+5)
for t in 0..4:
u[t] := (u0 + t*s) mod Md
return u
The output must satisfy (u_5=u_0) and matches the closed form (u_t=(u_0+t\cdot 3^{d+5})\bmod M_d).
13.1.3.2 Compute the visible station cycle and identify its corridor class
Algorithm 13.8 (SnapCycleSigma). Inputs: (d\ge 3), (u_0). Outputs: (\Sigma_t=\sigma(u_t)) and the corridor label (\Sigma_0\bmod 3).
function SnapCycleSigma(d, u0):
u = SnapCycleU(d, u0)
divisor := 3^(d+4)
for t in 0..4:
sigma[t] := floor(u[t] / divisor) // in {0..14}
class := sigma[0] mod 3
return (sigma, class)
At snap, the station update is (\sigma_{t+1}\equiv \sigma_t+3\pmod{15}).
13.1.3.3 Verify frozen remainder and emit the fiber signature
Algorithm 13.9 (VerifyFreezeQ). Inputs: (d,u_0). Outputs: fiber value (q_0) and a freeze verification flag.
function VerifyFreezeQ(d, u0):
Md := 15 * 3^(d+4)
s := 3^(d+5)
div := 3^(d+4)
u := u0
q0 := u mod div
for t in 1..4:
u := (u + s) mod Md
if (u mod div) != q0:
return (q0, FAIL)
return (q0, PASS)
At snap, (q(u_{t+1})=q(u_t)) holds exactly.
13.1.3.4 Generate certified snap tables across dimensions
Algorithm 13.10 (SnapTable). Inputs: range (d\in[d_{\min},d_{\max}]), canonical representative selection for (u_0). Outputs: a table of ((M_d,3^{d+4},3^{d+5})) and the explicit orbit formula.
The Holographic Tunneling specification enumerates (d=3..7) by listing:
divisor (3^{d+4}),
stride (3^{d+5}),
modulus (M_d=15\cdot 3^{d+4}),
orbit (u_t=u_0+3^{d+5}t\pmod{M_d}),with the rule that (q \bmod 3^{d+4}) is constant.
A certified implementation must treat this as a replayable generator producing a deterministic module artifact (Chapter 5.4).
13.1.4 Certificates
13.1.4.1 Snap regime correctness cert (modulus, stride, gcd, orbit length)
Certifies that:
(M_d=15\cdot 3^{d+4}) and (s(d)=3^{d+5}) are correctly instantiated,
(\gcd(M_d,s(d))=3^{d+5}), hence orbit length (5),
the explicit orbit formula (u_t=(u_0+t\cdot 3^{d+5})\bmod M_d) is satisfied.
13.1.4.2 Station-cycle projection cert ((\sigma)-advance and corridor class)
Certifies:
decoder (\sigma(u)=\lfloor u/3^{d+4}\rfloor\in{0,\dots,14}),
station update (\sigma_{t+1}\equiv \sigma_t+3\pmod{15}),
partition into three disjoint 5-cycles by (\sigma\bmod 3).
13.1.4.3 Frozen remainder cert (fiber invariance and admissibility)
Certifies:
(q(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}) is the declared fiber coordinate,
under stride (s(d)=3^{d+5}=3\cdot 3^{d+4}), (q(u_{t+1})=q(u_t)) holds exactly.The certificate includes admissibility conditions for quotient extraction (canonical representative selection) and any required replay transcripts.
13.1.4.4 Tunnel signature cert (visible motion + hidden invariance)
Certifies the combined statement:[\text{At }R=3^d,\ u\mapsto u+3^{d+5}\pmod{M_d}\ \text{changes }\sigma\ \text{in a 5-cycle while freezing }q.]The certificate must include:
the tunnel cycle record (\mathcal T_d(u_0)),
the station cycle record ({\Sigma_t}_{t=0}^4),
the fiber value (q(u_0)),
the replay transcript and minimal witness set enabling deterministic verification.
13.2 Flower — Conjugate multiplicative/additive forms and quotient–fiber actions
13.2.1 Objects
13.2.1.1 Group extension structure and coordinate split as an exact sequence
The quotient/fiber split (u\leftrightarrow(\sigma,q)) defines a canonical extension of groups:[0 \longrightarrow \mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}} \xrightarrow{\iota} \mathbb Z_{M_d} \xrightarrow{\pi} \mathbb Z_{15} \longrightarrow 0,]where (\iota(q)=q) embeds the fiber as low digits and (\pi(u)=\sigma(u)) projects to the station digit.
A fiber bundle record is:[\mathcal B_d := (U_d,\ \pi,\ \iota,\ \mathrm{SectionPolicy},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]where SectionPolicy pins canonical representatives used by the floor-division quotient map.
13.2.1.2 Snap step as a quotient translation with trivial fiber action
The snap step defines an automorphism of the extension that acts as:
translation by (+3) on the base (\mathbb Z_{15}),
identity on the fiber (\mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}}).
This is the Flower-layer statement that the dynamics factor through the quotient at snap while leaving the fiber unchanged.
13.2.1.3 Multiplicative scaling chart and induced fiber action
The refinement mechanism admits a multiplicative chart:[u \mapsto u' \equiv 3^n u \pmod{M_d}.]
Writing (u=\sigma 3^{d+4}+q), the induced fiber action is:[q' \equiv 3^n q \pmod{3^{d+4}},]since the station term vanishes modulo (3^{d+4}).
Thus, multiplicative scaling acts as a digit-shift operator on the fiber, providing a complementary representation of refinement dynamics.
13.2.1.4 Chart-switch object and commuting-diagram witnesses
A chart-switch object is a certified equivalence between:
the multiplicative scaling representation (u\mapsto 3^n u),
the additive stepping representation (u\mapsto u+3^{n+5}),
treated as two charts of the same underlying scaling action (“multiply in one chart becomes add in another chart”).
Chart-switch objects are implemented as EQUIV edges with:
a TransformRef identifying the chart change,
an observable set on which commutation is asserted,
defect bounds and admissibility guards,
commuting-diagram witnesses for route equivalences.
13.2.2 Calculus
13.2.2.1 Snap action factorization and semidirect product collapse
At snap, the extension action collapses to a direct-product action on ((\sigma,q)):[(\sigma,q)\longmapsto (\sigma+3,\ q).]
This is a semidirect-product viewpoint with trivial fiber action at snap: the base translation does not twist the fiber, and the fiber carries a conserved microstate label.
13.2.2.2 Conjugacy between multiplicative scaling and additive stepping
The multiplicative scaling chart implies digit-shift behavior in the fiber:[q' \equiv 3^n q \pmod{3^{d+4}}.]
The additive stepping chart makes freeze criteria an exact divisibility statement: the remainder (q(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}) is invariant under (u\mapsto u+3^{n+5}) precisely when (3^{n+5}) is a multiple of (3^{d+4}), i.e.[3^{n+5}\equiv 0\pmod{3^{d+4}}\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad n\ge d-1.]
Chart conjugacy is expressed as an EQUIV claim that these two representations implement the same scale action on the declared observables, with commutation defects bounded by corridor.
13.2.2.3 Coset structure of visible tunnels and orbit stratification
Since (\sigma\mapsto\sigma+3) preserves (\sigma\bmod 3), the base (\mathbb Z_{15}) splits into three invariant cosets, each giving a 5-cycle.
This is an orbit stratification on the quotient: the stabilizer of the (+3) action is the subgroup (3\mathbb Z_{15}), and the three corridor classes are the quotient (\mathbb Z_{15}/3\mathbb Z_{15}\cong \mathbb Z_3).
13.2.2.4 Coherence and holonomy under chart switches and quotient conventions
Because (\sigma) is defined by floor division, coherent use requires a pinned canonical representative selection for residue classes. Coherence conditions include:
stability of quotient extraction under modular arithmetic,
branch-like coherence of floor-based quotient selection (avoid inconsistent representative selection across replays),
bounded holonomy for loops combining chart switches and quotient extraction.
Nonzero holonomy indicates inconsistent conventions and must be recorded as a holonomy defect with corridor truth classification (Chapter 4, Chapter 5).
13.2.3 Algorithms
13.2.3.1 Build commuting diagrams comparing multiplicative and additive charts
Algorithm 13.27 (ChartCommuteCheck). Inputs: (d,n), observable (\mathcal O_{d,k}), test set (S\subseteq U_d). Outputs: defect between:[u \mapsto 3^n u \pmod{M_d}\quad\text{and}\quad u \mapsto u+3^{n+5}\pmod{M_d},]after applying (\mathcal O_{d,k}).
The algorithm emits a commuting-square witness when defect is zero or bounded, and emits AMBIG with evidence plan when admissibility cannot be certified.
13.2.3.2 Compute induced fiber action and compare to freeze conditions
Algorithm 13.28 (FiberActionCompare). Inputs: (d,n,q). Outputs:
multiplicative fiber update (q_{\times}=3^n q\bmod 3^{d+4}),
additive freeze predicate (n\ge d-1),
snap collapse predicate (n=d) for pure 5-cycle.
This algorithm is used to classify which chart provides the cleanest invariants for a given regime and corridor.
13.2.3.3 Canonicalize chart choice by invariant clarity and defect minimization
Algorithm 13.29 (CanonicalChartSelect). Inputs: claim type (need fiber freeze vs need digit shift), corridor policy, (d,n). Output: canonical chart selection (additive vs multiplicative) and required witness obligations.
Selection criteria:
choose additive chart when divisibility-based invariants (freeze) are the primary gate,
choose multiplicative chart when digit-shift structure or annihilation of lower digits is the primary gate,
resolve ties by minimal required obligations and deterministic replay cost.
13.2.3.4 Holonomy audit for chart-switch cycles
Algorithm 13.30 (ChartHolonomyAudit). Inputs: loop combining chart-switch edges and DUAL/EQUIV routes. Output: holonomy defect and quarantine triggers.
The audit compiles the loop into a replayable script and checks whether the induced action on pinned observables returns to identity within tolerance; failure yields a holonomy record and blocks OK sealing.
13.2.4 Certificates
13.2.4.1 Extension consistency cert (quotient/fiber split)
Certifies:
correctness of (\sigma(u)=\lfloor u/3^{d+4}\rfloor) and (q(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}),
uniqueness of reconstruction (u=\sigma 3^{d+4}+q) under canonical representatives,
scope and admissibility of quotient extraction conventions.
13.2.4.2 Chart conjugacy cert (multiply vs add as equivalent scale actions)
Certifies:
multiplicative map (u\mapsto 3^n u\pmod{M_d}),
induced fiber action (q'\equiv 3^n q \pmod{3^{d+4}}),
additive map (u\mapsto u+3^{n+5}\pmod{M_d}),
commutation on pinned observable sets, with defect bounds and admissibility guards.
13.2.4.3 Coset/5-cycle stratification cert
Certifies the three 5-cycles in (\mathbb Z_{15}) induced by (+3) stepping, and the corridor class labeling by (\sigma\bmod 3).
13.2.4.4 Holonomy boundedness cert for snap chart loops
Certifies that chart-switch loops and multi-route equivalences are coherent:
commuting diagrams close within corridor thresholds,
quotient extraction conventions do not introduce drift,
holonomy defects are bounded (or explicit obstruction packages are produced).
13.3 Cloud — Visibility vs hidden state: observation channels and inferential limits
13.3.1 Objects
13.3.1.1 Observation maps at macro and micro resolutions
Define observation maps:
macro observation: (Y_t:=\sigma(u_t)\in\mathbb Z_{15}),
micro observation: (Z_t:=q(u_t)\in\mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}}),
partial observation: (W_t:=(\sigma(u_t),u_t\bmod 3^k)) for chosen (k\le d+4).
At snap, (Y_t) cycles while (Z_t) is constant.
13.3.1.2 Deterministic Markov structure on (\mathbb Z_{15}) under snap
At snap, the macro observation is a deterministic periodic chain:[Y_{t+1} = Y_t + 3 \pmod{15},]hence (Y_t) is periodic with period 5 and remains within a fixed coset class (Y_0\bmod 3).
13.3.1.3 Indistinguishability fibers and alias classes under macro-only observation
Define macro indistinguishability:[u \sim_{\sigma} v \quad \Longleftrightarrow\quad \sigma(u)=\sigma(v).]Each station class contains (3^{d+4}) microstates, parameterized by (q). At snap, since (q) is invariant, observing a full macro cycle yields no additional information about (q(u_0)) beyond membership in the initial station class.
13.3.1.4 Uncertainty ledgers for tunnel inference
A tunnel inference ledger records:
which observation map was used ((\sigma)-only, (q)-only, mixed),
the posterior set of compatible fiber remainders (q),
identifiability status (unique vs set-valued),
any additional assumptions (priors, conditioning on events),
evidence plans for increasing observability level (k) when required.
13.3.2 Calculus
13.3.2.1 Data-processing boundary: projection erases fiber and blocks identifiability of (q)
The map (u\mapsto \sigma(u)) is non-invertible. Under snap, the fiber coordinate is invariant and is never coupled into the macro dynamics. Therefore, from ({Y_t}) alone, (q(u_0)) remains unidentifiable up to the full fiber size unless additional observables are introduced.
This boundary is enforced by corridor truth: any claim that reconstructs (q) from (\sigma)-only observations is a compile-time no-go unless explicitly set-valued or supported by added constraints.
13.3.2.2 Observational paradox formalization: “motion” depends on the observation functor
Define the observation functors:[\mathcal O_\sigma(u)=\sigma(u),\qquad \mathcal O_q(u)=q(u).]At snap:[\mathcal O_\sigma(u_{t+1})\neq \mathcal O_\sigma(u_t)\quad\text{in general},\qquad\mathcal O_q(u_{t+1})=\mathcal O_q(u_t)\ \ \forall t.]
Thus, “tunneling” is not a property of the latent dynamics alone; it is a property of the pair (dynamics, observation). The latent evolution is a constant-step translation; the tunnel phenomenon is the quotient-level appearance induced by forgetting the fiber.
13.3.2.3 Conditioning and evidence: when additional observables resolve fiber ambiguity
Fiber ambiguity may be reduced only by:
observing additional digits (increase (k) in (u\bmod 3^k)),
introducing auxiliary observations correlated with (q) (domain-specific readouts),
imposing certified prior constraints that restrict (q) to a subset.
All such restrictions must be recorded as obligations and assumptions in the corridor ledger. Without them, the posterior over (q) is set-valued.
13.3.2.4 Dimension amplification of ambiguity and “delayed reveal”
As (d) increases, fiber size (3^{d+4}) grows exponentially. Thus macro-only observation produces exponentially larger indistinguishability classes. The Holographic Tunneling analysis explicitly records that higher dimension increases internal 3-power strata and delays when the snap corridor becomes visible at a given revolution scale.
13.3.3 Algorithms
13.3.3.1 Generate macro observation sequence and certify period
Algorithm 13.42 (ObserveSigmaAtSnap). Inputs: (d,u_0). Outputs: ({Y_t}_{t=0}^4) and period certificate.
Compute (u_t) by Algorithm 13.7, then compute (Y_t=\sigma(u_t)). Verify:[Y_{t+1}\equiv Y_t+3\pmod{15},\quad Y_5=Y_0.]
13.3.3.2 Compute fiber posterior set under macro-only observations
Algorithm 13.43 (PosteriorFiberSetSigmaOnly). Inputs: (d), observed macro station (Y_0). Output: fiber candidate set[\mathcal Q := {q\in \mathbb Z_{3^{d+4}}},]together with the reconstruction set[\mathcal U := {u=Y_0\cdot 3^{d+4}+q:\ q\in\mathcal Q},]under canonical representatives.
At snap, observing the entire macro cycle adds no constraint on (q) beyond the initial station constraint, because (q) is invariant and the macro evolution depends only on (\sigma).
13.3.3.3 Evidence-plan generator: minimal observability upgrade to constrain (q)
Algorithm 13.44 (PlanObservabilityUpgradeForQ). Inputs: (d), desired reduction of fiber ambiguity, budget. Output: minimal (k) such that observing (u\bmod 3^k) yields a nontrivial constraint set.
If an auxiliary measurement can reveal (u\bmod 3^k) for (k>0), then the candidate set reduces from (3^{d+4}) to (3^{d+4-k}). The algorithm emits obligations specifying how the extra observation is obtained and verified.
13.3.3.4 Robust inference under noisy observation channels
When observations are noisy, treat (Y_t) as an output of a channel (\Lambda(y\mid u)) and infer (u_0) or (q(u_0)) only with explicit confidence semantics. Any stochastic inference must pin randomness and produce tail/mixing certificates consistent with corridor policy (Chapter 4, Chapter 5).
13.3.4 Certificates
13.3.4.1 Macro-period cert (deterministic 5-cycle on (\sigma))
Certifies that in snap regime:[\sigma(u_{t+1})\equiv \sigma(u_t)+3\pmod{15},]and hence macro observation is 5-periodic.
13.3.4.2 Fiber nonidentifiability cert under (\sigma)-only observation
Certifies that:
the observation (\sigma) is constant on fibers of size (3^{d+4}),
snap dynamics preserve (q),
therefore macro observations do not constrain (q) beyond initial station membership.
This certificate is expressed as an ambiguity certificate: the posterior over (q) is the entire fiber unless extra observables are introduced and certified.
13.3.4.3 Observation consistency certs for mixed observability levels
Certifies correctness of observation maps (u\mapsto(\sigma,u\bmod 3^k)) and their admissibility on canonical representatives, including correct floor-division quotient extraction.
13.3.4.4 Ledger completeness cert for tunnel inference
Certifies that any inference artifact includes:
explicit observation model,
explicit CandidateSet sizes for hidden fiber,
explicit obligations/evidence plans for disambiguation,
no illicit promotion of set-valued outcomes to unique values without certificates.
13.4 Fractal — Multiscale snap visibility, delayed reveal, and seed compression of tunnel theorems
13.4.1 Objects
13.4.1.1 Parameter space ((d,n)) and the snap threshold hypersurface
Define the regime parameter space ((d,n)). The snap hypersurface is:[n=d,]with snap orbit length (L(d,d)=5) independent of (d).
Associated objects:
orbit length function (L(d,n)),
frozen-digit depth (3^{n+5}) (partial freeze),
full fiber freeze threshold (n\ge d-1).
13.4.1.2 Visibility threshold and “dimension delays the reveal” objects
Define a visibility threshold for a chosen observation level: the smallest (n) at which the projected dynamics exhibit the 5-cycle structure rather than longer orbits or apparent drift.
The tunneling analysis records that higher dimension increases internal 3-power strata and therefore increases the (n) required before the snap corridor manifests in the coarse projection as a pure 5-cycle.
This is stored as a Fractal object:[\mathrm{Reveal}(d):=(n_{\mathrm{snap}}=d,\ \mathrm{PreSnap}(d),\ \mathrm{DelayLaw}),]with DelayLaw specifying how fixed (n) yields different orbit lengths as (d) varies via (L(d,n)=5\cdot 3^{d-n}) for (n\le d).
13.4.1.3 Tunnel theorem seeds and module sealing
A snap tunnel seed is a compact proof-carrying object encoding:
(M_d), (s(d)), and the u-cycle formula,
decoders (\sigma,q) and their snap update laws,
a minimal witness set establishing the Snap Tunneling Theorem,
replay scripts to regenerate cycle tables (including (d=3..7) exemplars).
The seed is sealed as a module in the MyceliumGraph (Chapter 5.4) for deterministic expansion.
13.4.1.4 Refinement towers and observability ladders as holographic compression hierarchy
Fractal structure combines:
refinement depth (d) (carrier growth),
octave index (n) (stride growth),
observability level (k) (digit visibility),into a 3-axis ladder that governs when tunnels are observable and how ambiguity scales.
The snap tunnel theorem is the fixed-point of this ladder: regardless of (d), at (n=d) the macro dynamics collapse to a 5-cycle while the entire fiber remainder freezes.
13.4.2 Calculus
13.4.2.1 Orbit-length scaling law and collapse to period 5
For fixed (n), increasing (d) multiplies the orbit length by powers of 3:[L(d,n)=5\cdot 3^{d-n}\quad(n\le d),]and collapses to 5 only once (n\ge d).
This is a multiscale collapse law: snap is the threshold where the stride includes enough 3-power to factor out the internal strata and leave only the 5-cycle on the station quotient.
13.4.2.2 Freeze ladder and the approach to full fiber invariance
Additive stepping by (3^{n+5}) freezes all digits below (3^{n+5}) (partial freeze), and freezes the full station-resolution remainder (q(u)=u\bmod 3^{d+4}) once (n\ge d-1).
Snap (n=d) is the regime where the orbit simultaneously:
attains minimal period 5,
preserves the full remainder exactly.
13.4.2.3 Dimension-delay theorem as a statement about thresholds under fixed (n)
Fix (n). For larger (d), the internal remainder modulus (3^{d+4}) increases, and therefore the snap condition (n=d) is met only at higher refinement depth. The resulting phenomenon is:
the visible 5-cycle exists structurally at the snap threshold,
but it is not observable at a given (n) if (d>n) because the orbit length is (5\cdot 3^{d-n}) and the station projection does not collapse to a pure 5-cycle at that scale.
This is recorded explicitly as “dimension delays the reveal” in the tunneling analysis.
13.4.2.4 Budgeted proof expansion and safety against combinatorial explosion
Because (M_d) grows as (3^{d}), exhaustive enumeration at high (d) is intractable. Therefore:
theorem statements are stored as seeds with replayable generators (Chapter 8),
expansions are bounded by corridor budgets (Chapter 4),
any request for explicit tables beyond pinned ranges yields AMBIG with an evidence plan (increase compute budget, restrict (d), or compute only projected observables).
13.4.3 Algorithms
13.4.3.1 Regime classifier ((d,n)\mapsto) (orbit length, freeze depth, snap flag)
Algorithm 13.58 (ClassifySnapRegime). Inputs: (d,n). Outputs: (L(d,n)), frozen digit modulus (3^{n+5}), full-freeze flag (n\ge d-1), snap flag (n=d).
Orbit length is computed by the closed form.
13.4.3.2 Generate a snap tunnel seed (proof-carrying module)
Algorithm 13.59 (GenerateSnapSeed). Inputs: (d), corridor policy set. Outputs: seed module for Theorem 13.6.
The seed includes:
the defining equations for (M_d) and (s(d)),
the explicit orbit formula,
the (\sigma) and (q) update laws,
minimal witness set and deterministic replay pointers.
13.4.3.3 Multi-(d) snap table generator with certified projection invariants
Algorithm 13.60 (GenerateSnapTableRange). Inputs: (d_{\min},d_{\max}). Outputs: list of tuples ((M_d,3^{d+4},3^{d+5})) and a proof that each instance satisfies the snap theorem.
The tunneling specification provides explicit exemplars for (d=3..7) by listing divisor, stride, modulus, and the orbit formula; these exemplars serve as canonical test vectors for regression.
13.4.3.4 Regression check: stability of snap theorem artifacts across editions
Algorithm 13.61 (SnapRegressionAudit). Inputs: prior seed module, current seed module, corridor policies. Outputs: regression certificate.
Checks:
EdgeID stability for unchanged artifacts,
equality of replay outputs,
consistency of theorem statement hashes,
preservation of decoder conventions and admissibility guards.
Any drift triggers MIGRATE edges or quarantine overlays (Chapter 5).
13.4.4 Certificates
13.4.4.1 Regime classification cert (orbit law and threshold predicates)
Certifies:
correctness of (L(d,n)) and (\gcd(M_d,s(n))) computations,
correctness of snap identification (n=d\Rightarrow L=5).
13.4.4.2 Dimension-delay cert (visibility threshold under increasing (d))
Certifies that for fixed (n), increasing (d) increases orbit length and delays collapse to the pure 5-cycle, and records the snap threshold (n=d) as the reveal condition.
13.4.4.3 Seed integrity cert for snap tunnel modules
Certifies that the snap tunnel seed satisfies the compression contract and replay closure:
expanding the seed regenerates the theorem statement and proofs,
replay outputs match commitments,
compress(expand(seed)) returns the seed,
all dependencies resolve and corridor budgets close.
13.4.4.4 Multiscale coherence cert (projection, freeze, and chart consistency)
Certifies:
coherence of quotient/fiber projection with the snap dynamics,
correctness of the freeze ladder threshold (n\ge d-1),
bounded twist/holonomy for any certified chart-switch claims linking multiplicative and additive representations.
CHAPTER 13 — SNAP TUNNELING THEOREM: 5-CYCLES AND FROZEN REMAINDERS (Addr ⟨0030⟩₄)
Chapter 14 — Shadow Crystal: Failure Modes, Obstructions, Illegal Moves (Addr ⟨0031⟩₄)
14.1 Square — Discrete illegality: combinatorial, summation, dynamical, spectral failures
14.1.1 Objects
14.1.1.1 Shadow Crystal object and the 64 anti-expression index
The Shadow Crystal is the negative-space dual of the 64-operation crystal: it is the catalogue of operation classes that are formally writable but inadmissible under corridor truth because they violate invariants, destroy information without ledger, or require impossible resources. The Shadow Crystal is structured as 64 anti-expressions, obtained by projecting 4 canonical No-Go types (mapped to the 4 elements) through the 4 Shapes across 4 Levels, i.e. (4\times4\times4=64).
Definition 14.1 (Anti-expression index). Define:
Shapes (\mathcal L:={\mathrm{Square},\mathrm{Flower},\mathrm{Cloud},\mathrm{Fractal}}),
Elements (\mathcal E:={\mathrm{Earth},\mathrm{Water},\mathrm{Fire},\mathrm{Air}}),
Levels (\mathcal K:={L0,L1,L2,L3}).An anti-expression address is:[\mathrm{AEAddr}:=(\ell,e,k)\in \mathcal L\times\mathcal E\times\mathcal K,]and the Shadow Crystal is the set:[\mathrm{ShadowCrystal} := {\mathrm{AE}(\ell,e,k)}_{(\ell,e,k)\in \mathcal L\times\mathcal E\times\mathcal K}.]
14.1.1.2 Canonical No-Go types as element-indexed failure modes
The Shadow Crystal is generated by four canonical No-Go types, each mapped to an element axis:
Earth (Type I — Combinatorial violation): collapse without scale; attempting (\infty\to 1) (or (\infty\to) finite) while claiming invariants are preserved.
Water (Type II — Analytic violation): division by zero / improper limit; assigning finite values to divergences or singularities without regularization (“crossing a singularity without tunneling”).
Fire (Type III — Dynamical violation): unbounded amplification; finite-time blow-up or exact loops in strictly expanding systems (“infinite energy in finite time”).
Air (Type IV — Spectral violation): false unitarity; claiming perfect information preservation and invertibility in systems that are lossy, aliased, or truncated (“perfect reconstruction from insufficient data”).
Definition 14.2 (Elemental no-go predicate family). For each element (e\in\mathcal E), define a predicate (\mathrm{NoGo}_e) on programs/operations/presentations (P) in a corridor (C) and a declared region (S):[\mathrm{NoGo}_e(P;C,S)\in{\texttt{true},\texttt{false},\texttt{ambig}},]where (\texttt{ambig}) is permitted only when corridor allows evidence-planned undecidability (Chapter 4). Each (\mathrm{NoGo}_e) is specified by a violation predicate (14.1.2.), a required witness schema (14.1.4.), and a repair move set (14.1.3.*).
14.1.1.3 Square anti-expression schema (discrete/linear violations)
Square anti-expressions apply when carriers are discrete, linear, or combinatorial (counting, grids, finite-dimensional linear algebra, discrete transforms). The Shadow Crystal explicitly enumerates Square anti-expressions as “Discrete / Linear Violations” across levels, with representative examples such as “Infinite Collapse,” “Divergent Sum,” “Expansive Loop,” and “False Unitary.”
Definition 14.3 (Square anti-expression record). A Square anti-expression is a record:[\mathrm{AE}(\mathrm{Square},e,k):=(\mathrm{Trigger},\ \mathrm{Violation},\ \mathrm{LowerBound},\ \mathrm{RepairMoves},\ \mathrm{QuarantineRule})]with:
Trigger: a static signature over typed objects (operators, transforms, solver templates, invariants) indicating the risk of illegality,
Violation: a decidable predicate when sufficient certificates exist,
LowerBound: a proof object certifying the violation cannot be repaired within allowable moves,
RepairMoves: admissible reroutes or regularizations (when any exist),
QuarantineRule: overlay enforcement policy (Chapter 5.4).
14.1.1.4 Minimal witness objects and quarantine overlays for Square illegality
A “no-go” must be explainable by a minimal witness set, suitable for deterministic replay and regression.
Definition 14.4 (No-go witness). A no-go witness is a tuple:[W := (\mathrm{AEAddr},\ \mathrm{ClaimAddr},\ \mathrm{ViolationPredicateNF},\ \mathrm{MinimalCore},\ \mathrm{ReplayPtr},\ \mathrm{BoundType},\ \mathrm{BoundValue}),]where:
MinimalCore is a minimal inconsistent subset of assumptions/edges sufficient to reproduce the violation (Chapter 5.2.3.4),
BoundType indicates exact violation, certified lower bound, or certified impossibility under corridor.
Definition 14.5 (Quarantine overlay for no-go). A quarantine overlay is:[Q := (\mathrm{OverlayID},\ \mathrm{BlockedSet},\ \mathrm{Reason}=W,\ \mathrm{RepairMoves},\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{CorridorID}),]and is applied during closure compilation and verdict evaluation to block downstream OK sealing (Chapter 5.4.1.4).
14.1.2 Calculus
14.1.2.1 Earth no-go in Square: infinite collapse without coarse-graining
Earth–Square no-go detects combinatorial illegality: collapsing infinite (or unbounded) state complexity into a finite summary while claiming preservation of counting invariants.
Violation predicate (Square⊗Earth). A Square program violates Earth if it asserts an injective- or invariant-preserving compression without an explicit coarse-graining parameter. Formally, if a program constructs a map (F:\mathcal X\to \mathcal Y) with (|\mathcal X|=\infty) and (|\mathcal Y|<\infty) (or (\mathcal X) has unbounded combinatorial entropy) and simultaneously asserts invariance of a counting/entropy functional (H) across the map, then it is illegal unless:
a coarse-graining rule (\Pi_\epsilon) is explicitly declared (Fractal/Ψ component), and
the entropy loss is ledgered and bounded by corridor.
The Shadow Crystal describes this as “collapse without scale” and “(\infty\to 1) without cost.”
Admissible repairs. Earth no-go is repaired only by:
introducing an explicit scale parameter (coarse-graining operator) and migrating the claim to a Fractal corridor (Chapter 6.4, Chapter 7.4), or
weakening the claim to a set-valued or statistical statement with explicit information-loss ledger (Cloud/Fractal), or
restricting (\mathcal X) to a finite subset by explicit domain constraints (Square domain restriction).
14.1.2.2 Water no-go in Square: divergent sum and illegal limit coercion
Water–Square no-go detects analytic illegality in discrete contexts: asserting finiteness of divergent sums/limits without specifying regularization or admissibility boundaries.
The Shadow Crystal explicitly identifies Water as “division by zero / improper limit,” including “crossing a singularity without tunneling.”
Violation predicate (Square⊗Water). A Square program violates Water if it:
constructs a series (\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n) or a discrete limit (L=\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n),
fails to prove absolute convergence or fails to declare a corridor-permitted regularization functional (\mathcal R),
and asserts a finite value (L\in\mathbb R) as an OK-level equality.
Representative anti-expression: “Asserting that a divergent series (like (\sum 1)) has a specific finite value without specifying a regularization scheme.”
Admissible repairs. Water no-go is repaired only by:
introducing a corridor-permitted regularization operator (\mathcal R) (e.g., principal value, zeta regularization) with explicit domain and invariance constraints, and downgrading to NEAR/conditional truth unless fully certified, or
refining the domain to exclude the singularity and asserting a local claim only, or
tunneling: switching representation so the singularity becomes a removable defect under a different chart and then proving commutation/defect bounds (Chapters 13–15). The no-go text explicitly frames the illegal move as “crossing a singularity without tunneling,” thus defining tunneling as the lawful repair primitive.
14.1.2.3 Fire no-go in Square: expansive loop and finite-time blow-up contradictions
Fire–Square no-go detects dynamical impossibility within discrete/linear dynamics: exact cycles in strictly expanding systems or claims that avoid blow-up when growth is certified.
The Shadow Crystal identifies Fire as “finite-time infinite blow-up or exact loops in strictly expanding systems.”Representative Square anti-expression: “Claiming an exact, repeating finite cycle exists in a dynamical system that is strictly expanding.”
Violation predicate (Square⊗Fire). A Square program violates Fire if it asserts periodicity or boundedness under certified strict expansion. A canonical formulation:
Let (F:X\to X) be a discrete update map on a normed space with an expansion lower bound on a region (S):[|F(x)-F(y)|\ \ge\ \lambda|x-y|\quad \forall x,y\in S,\ \lambda>1,]and the program asserts existence of a periodic orbit (x=F^k(x)) with (k>0) fully contained in (S), or asserts global boundedness without providing a scale-relief mechanism. Under strict expansion, nontrivial periodic orbits in (S) are incompatible with the expansion inequality unless the region is degenerate or the inequality is not valid on the orbit; therefore the claim is a no-go unless the program supplies a certificate that either:
expansion does not hold on the orbit (domain refinement), or
a compensating dissipative/renormalization mechanism exists (introducing (D) or (\Psi) components) and is ledgered.
Admissible repairs. Fire no-go is repaired by:
explicit dissipative terms (introduce (D)-pole) with energy budget and decay certificates (Chapter 6.1),
explicit renormalization/scale relief (introduce (\Psi)-pole) with contraction certificates (Chapter 6.4),
restricting the claim to finite time and bounding growth by explicit budgets.
14.1.2.4 Air no-go in Square: false unitarity and rank/alias contradictions
Air–Square no-go detects spectral and information-preservation illegality in discrete transforms: claiming unitary/invertible structure when the transform is non-orthogonal, rank-deficient, or aliased.
The Shadow Crystal defines Air as “false unitarity” and “perfect reconstruction from insufficient data.”Representative Square anti-expression: “Constructing a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with a non-orthogonal kernel but asserting it is perfectly unitary and reversible.”
Violation predicate (Square⊗Air). A Square program violates Air if it asserts unitarity or perfect invertibility of a linear map (T:\mathbb C^n\to\mathbb C^n) when:
(T^\ast T\neq I) and the discrepancy is certified above corridor threshold, or
(\mathrm{rank}(T)<n) (rank deficiency), or
the program performs truncation/compression (e.g., discarding modes) and then asserts exact reconstruction without storing the discarded information.
In discrete signal processing terms: if an operator discards degrees of freedom, the inverse cannot exist on the full space; any claim otherwise is an Air no-go unless the output is explicitly set-valued (pseudo-inverse with nullspace ambiguity) and the ambiguity is carried into ledgers/corridor truth.
Admissible repairs. Air no-go is repaired by:
restricting to the invariant subspace where (T) is unitary/invertible (domain restriction + certificates),
recording nullspace ambiguity and returning set-valued inverses (AMBIG/NEAR under corridor),
adding missing information channels (increase observability, avoid aliasing), or
switching representation such that the transform becomes orthogonal/unitary (conjugacy route with certificates; Chapter 3).
14.1.3 Algorithms
14.1.3.1 Square no-go detector: structural static checks and certified lower bounds
Algorithm 14.6 (DetectNoGoSquare). Input: a typed program (P) (ISA sequence), declared region (S), corridor (C). Output: PASS/AMBIG/FAIL with no-go witness or evidence plan.
Stages:
Earth checks (collapse without scale). Detect claims of invariant preservation across explicit compression (X\to Y) with (|Y|) finite or with declared information loss unledgered; search for missing coarse-grain parameter or missing ledger entries.
Water checks (divergent sums/limits). Detect unregularized divergence claims: series/integral limit without convergence certificate or without declared regularization operator; attempt to prove divergence using certified comparison tests or known lower bounds.
Fire checks (expansive loop). Detect periodicity/boundedness claims under certified expansion/growth; attempt to derive contradiction using contraction/expansion inequalities or energy monotones.
Air checks (false unitarity). Detect unitarity/invertibility claims; compute rank and orthogonality defects; detect truncation→reconstruction claims.
The detector must emit a minimal witness set sufficient to reproduce the failure by deterministic replay when FAIL is returned (Chapter 5.3).
14.1.3.2 Minimal witness extraction for Square no-go events
Algorithm 14.7 (MinWitnessNoGo). Input: detected violation with candidate core set of premises/edges (\mathcal S). Output: minimal core (\mathcal S^\star\subseteq \mathcal S).
Deterministic pruning:
Order premises deterministically (by GlobalAddrNF then EdgeID).
For each premise (p\in\mathcal S), test whether (\mathcal S\setminus{p}) still reproduces the violation by replay.
Remove (p) if violation persists; otherwise retain.
Repeat until a fixed point is reached.
This yields a minimal witness core suitable for FAIL minimal witness certificates (Chapter 4.1.4.4) and conflict packets (Chapter 5.1.2.4).
14.1.3.3 Quarantine overlay generation and downstream blocking
Algorithm 14.8 (QuarantineOnNoGo). Input: no-go witness (W), corridor (C), scope policy. Output: quarantine overlay (Q).
Rules:
Block sealing (L3) of any claim whose closure graph depends on the minimal core of (W).
Block route canonicalization that would traverse no-go edges unless a repair move is applied.
Attach repair moves enumerated for the no-go type:
Earth: introduce coarse-grain scale parameter or restrict domain.
Water: regularize or tunnel (switch representation) with commutation certificates.
Fire: add dissipative/renormalization mechanism or bound time horizon.
Air: restrict to invertible subspace, add missing channels, or downgrade to set-valued inverse.
14.1.3.4 Repair move synthesis: local reroutes and representation switches
Algorithm 14.9 (SynthesizeRepairMovesSquare). Input: no-go type (e), failing program (P), corridor (C). Output: candidate repaired programs ({P_i}) with obligations.
Synthesis rules:
Replace illegal move with a legal composite:
Water: replace singular crossing with tunnel route (Chapter 15 router) by switching charts and adding regularization; require commuting-diagram closure.
Air: replace inverse by pseudo-inverse + nullspace certificate; downgrade claim to AMBIG/NEAR.
Fire: insert multiscale correction step or dissipative clamp.
Earth: insert coarse-graining operator with explicit scale.
All candidates are returned as a CandidateSet unless a unique repair is certified under corridor tie-break laws (Chapter 5.3.2.3).
14.1.4 Certificates
14.1.4.1 Square no-go detection certs (trigger → predicate → witness)
Certifies that:
the no-go trigger pattern matches the program in NF,
the violation predicate holds on the declared region (S),
the evaluation is deterministic and replayable,
the produced witness core reproduces the violation.
For Air no-go, the cert includes rank/orthogonality defect computations; for Fire, it includes growth lower bounds; for Water, divergence lower bounds; for Earth, information-loss/collapse mismatch evidence.
14.1.4.2 Lower bound (obstruction) certs: impossibility within allowable moves
Certifies that a violation cannot be repaired within the allowable move set (\mathcal A_C) of the corridor:[\Delta^\star := \inf_{a\in\mathcal A_C}\Delta(a)\ \ge\ \eta>0,]for a pinned defect metric (\Delta). This is the formal obstruction certificate (Chapter 4.2.2.2) specialized to Square no-go patterns.
14.1.4.3 Minimal witness certs and regression stability
Certifies minimality of the witness core under the pinned pruning algorithm and that the failure reproduces under regression replays (kernel versions pinned).
14.1.4.4 Quarantine compliance cert for Square shadow events
Certifies that:
quarantine overlays are applied to all impacted downstream claims,
no blocked claim is promoted to OK without a certified repair,
any override is explicit and corridor-governed,
the set of blocked edges/nodes is complete under closure compilation.
14.2 Flower — Geometric obstructions, gauge failures, and continuous shadow moves
14.2.1 Objects
14.2.1.1 Flower anti-expression schema (continuous/geometric violations)
Flower anti-expressions encode failures in curvature, calculus, waves, and continuous transforms. The Shadow Crystal explicitly enumerates Flower anti-expressions as “Continuous / Geometric Violations,” including examples such as degenerate metrics treated invertible, non-integrable singularities treated classically, superlinear blow-up ignored, and distributional Fourier fallacies.
Definition 14.10 (Flower anti-expression record). A Flower anti-expression (\mathrm{AE}(\mathrm{Flower},e,k)) is a record of:
geometric structure assumed (metric, manifold, symplectic form),
analytic structure assumed (integrability class, distribution spaces),
the violation predicate and required obstruction witness,
admissible repair moves (regularization, domain restriction, gauge-fix, or tunneling).
14.2.1.2 Earth in Flower: geometric collapse and noninvertible structure
Representative anti-expression: treating a degenerate metric as invertible and nondegenerate.
Definition 14.11 (Geometric nondegeneracy invariant). A metric tensor (g) is nondegenerate on region (S) if (\det g(x)\neq 0) for all (x\in S). A Flower Earth violation occurs if the program:
assumes invertibility of (g) (uses (g^{-1}) in computation),
while (\det g) vanishes on (S) or a certified lower bound fails.
14.2.1.3 Water in Flower: non-integrable singularities and improper limits
Representative anti-expression: integrating a non-absolutely integrable singularity and treating it as a standard classical function.
Definition 14.12 (Integrability class). For a function (f), admissibility requires membership in a pinned integrability class (e.g., (L^1), (L^2), tempered distributions). Water violations occur when a computation assumes (f\in L^1) or assumes interchange of limits/integrals without certifying dominated convergence conditions, or without declaring distributional semantics or regularization.
14.2.1.4 Fire/Air in Flower: blow-up avoidance and distribution fallacies
Representative anti-expressions:
Fire: asserting a global solution exists for an explosive superlinear ODE/PDE without blow-up.
Air: treating the Fourier transform of a distribution as a smooth (L^2) function (distribution fallacy).
These objects define:
blow-up criteria and maximal existence intervals as invariants,
function-space typing as a strict admissibility gate for transforms.
14.2.2 Calculus
14.2.2.1 Diagram-defect interpretation as geometric obstruction
Geometric coherence is validated by commuting diagrams between coordinate charts, gauge choices, and transforms. A Flower shadow event occurs when a required diagram cannot commute because one branch requires illegal operations (degenerate inversion, non-integrable transforms).
Violation is recorded as:
a nonzero commutation defect with certified lower bound (obstruction), or
a failure of admissibility due to missing domain/regularity assumptions.
14.2.2.2 Water no-go as “bad limit” and illegal singular crossing
Water no-go in Flower corresponds to coercing improper limits to finite values without regularization; the Shadow Crystal explicitly frames this as “crossing a singularity without tunneling.”
Formally, any operation that attempts to extend a functional across a singular set (\Sigma) must:
declare a regularization operator (\mathcal R) and prove regularization independence on the region of interest, or
tunnel to a representation in which the singularity is avoided and prove commutation/defect bounds.
Absent these, the operation is a Water no-go.
14.2.2.3 Gauge/fiber failures as structural obstructions
Gauge-fixing failures and holonomy indicate that no global representative exists, or that a chosen representative is inconsistent across loops. Such failures are Flower-layer obstructions: they are recorded as gauge-fix obstruction certificates and can force AMBIG (set-valued outcomes) or FAIL (when uniqueness is required).
14.2.2.4 Spectral illegality in continuous transforms
Air no-go in Flower often appears as mis-typing of transforms (distribution fallacy) or misuse of spectral calculus (e.g., assuming diagonalization exists without normality/self-adjointness). Such failures are detected by:
function-space mismatch (typed failure),
nonexistence of required spectral decompositions,
violation of unitarity/symplecticity assumptions beyond tolerance.
14.2.3 Algorithms
14.2.3.1 Geometric admissibility checker (metric, regularity, integrability)
Detect:
metric degeneracy on region (S),
missing regularity for derivatives/traces,
missing integrability for transforms,
branch cut crossings for multi-valued analytic primitives.
Outputs: PASS/AMBIG/FAIL and obligations.
14.2.3.2 Singular-crossing detector and tunnel requirement generator
When an operation’s domain intersects a singular set (\Sigma) and the claim asserts finite value across (\Sigma), generate:
FAIL (if corridor forbids such extension),
or AMBIG with evidence plan to provide regularization or to tunnel to a chart where the singularity is excluded.
14.2.3.3 Blow-up auditor for continuous dynamics
For evolution equations with superlinear growth, detect whether a claim of global existence contradicts known blow-up criteria or energy bounds; emit Fire no-go packages when contradiction is certified.
14.2.3.4 Distribution-space type checker for transform claims
For Fourier/Laplace transforms and spectral decompositions:
verify that input object lies in the declared space (e.g., (L^1), (L^2), tempered distributions),
verify that the output is claimed in a compatible space,
flag “distribution fallacy” when a distribution is treated as a smooth function without certification.
14.2.4 Certificates
14.2.4.1 Degeneracy and noninvertibility certs (Flower⊗Earth)
Certify metric degeneracy, Jacobian rank loss, or noninvertibility on the declared region; produce an obstruction witness for any claim requiring invertibility.
14.2.4.2 Bad-limit and singular-crossing certs (Flower⊗Water)
Certify divergence or non-integrability and the absence of corridor-permitted regularization; or certify that a declared regularization is admissible and commutes with required operations (if used as repair).
14.2.4.3 Blow-up obstruction certs (Flower⊗Fire)
Certify finite-time blow-up or impossibility of global solutions under declared growth conditions; or certify boundedness under added dissipative/renormalization mechanisms when used as repair.
14.2.4.4 Transform typing and distribution certs (Flower⊗Air)
Certify correct function-space typing and admissibility of transform claims; certify “distribution fallacy” violations when transforms are mis-typed, using minimal witness extraction and replay.
14.3 Cloud — Probabilistic illegality: negative probability, false limits, impossible inference
14.3.1 Objects
14.3.1.1 Cloud anti-expression schema (probabilistic/stochastic violations)
Cloud anti-expressions encode failures in probability axioms, entropy, estimation, and stochastic process semantics. The Shadow Crystal enumerates Cloud anti-expressions across levels with representative violations such as negative probabilities, invalid expectations under heavy tails, nonexistent stationary distributions for transient chains, false LLN/CLT applications, and false reversals of entropy production.
Definition 14.13 (Cloud anti-expression record). A Cloud anti-expression (\mathrm{AE}(\mathrm{Cloud},e,k)) specifies:
stochastic object type (measure, kernel, process, phase distribution),
admissibility conditions (positivity, normalization, integrability, mixing),
violation predicate and minimal witness,
repair moves (robust estimators, revised assumptions, set-valued semantics, or abstention).
14.3.1.2 Earth in Cloud: counting violations and probability axiom breaks
Representative anti-expression: “Negative Probability: probabilities <0 or >1 in Kolmogorov systems.”
Definition 14.14 (Kolmogorov admissibility). A probability assignment (P:\mathcal F\to\mathbb R) is admissible if:
(0\le P(A)\le 1),
(P(\Omega)=1),
countable additivity holds.Violations of these are Earth no-go in Cloud; they are structural and yield FAIL in all corridors that treat the object as a true probability measure (unless explicitly using quasi-probabilities, which must be declared and cannot be used as probabilities).
14.3.1.3 Water in Cloud: bad expectations and measure-theoretic illegality
Representative anti-expression: “Bad Expectation: expectations of variables with heavy tails (no mean).”
Water in Cloud includes:
using expectations when integrability does not hold,
pushing measures through non-measurable maps (explicitly listed at L3).
14.3.1.4 Fire/Air in Cloud: impossible processes and false coherence
Representative anti-expressions include:
“No Stationary: stationary distribution for transient chains” (process illegality),
“False CLT: Gaussian limits for variables with infinite variance” and “Explosive Drift” (process blow-up / invalid limit claims),
“False Reversal: reversing entropy production without cost” and “False Coherence: ignoring phase decoherence in quantum limits.”
Air in Cloud is spectral/phase illegality: treating phase coherence as preserved when channels are decohering or when data is insufficient to reconstruct phase, which is the probabilistic analog of false unitarity.
14.3.2 Calculus
14.3.2.1 Cloud Earth: axioms as hard invariants
Earth–Cloud no-go predicates are hard: violations of positivity, normalization, or additivity cannot be repaired by tuning. Repair requires changing semantic type (e.g., declaring quasi-probabilities), and then updating all dependent claims to respect that weaker semantics; otherwise FAIL.
14.3.2.2 Cloud Water: integrability and measurability as admissibility gates
Water–Cloud no-go arises when the program assumes integrability without certification. A canonical violation: applying LLN/CLT where variance is infinite, which the Shadow Crystal lists explicitly.
Corridor discipline:
integrability assumptions must be explicit and supported (tail certificates),
otherwise the claim is AMBIG or FAIL depending on whether the claim can be reformulated in robust terms.
14.3.2.3 Cloud Fire: process blow-up and impossible stationarity claims
Fire–Cloud no-go addresses process-level impossibilities: transient chains do not admit stationary distributions, explosive drift cannot be ignored, and large deviation/entropy production cannot be reversed without explicit cost.
14.3.2.4 Cloud Air: phase/coherence claims as identifiability and information constraints
Air–Cloud no-go is the probabilistic mirror of false unitarity: claiming perfect reconstruction or preserved coherence from insufficient data or through decohering channels. The violation predicate is:
the channel is lossy (data processing), and
the claim asserts invertibility/coherence without additional information.
Repairs require:
adding measurement channels (increase observability),
adopting set-valued/interval outcomes,
or explicitly modeling decoherence and downgrading claims.
14.3.3 Algorithms
14.3.3.1 Probability sanity checks and measure typing validator
Validate:
positivity and normalization,
measurability of maps used in pushforward,
existence of required moments/expectations.
Return FAIL for structural violations; return AMBIG with evidence plan when integrability is uncertain.
14.3.3.2 Tail-regime and LLN/CLT admissibility auditor
Detect false asymptotic claims by checking tail regime certificates and dependence/mixing assumptions; if variance is infinite or mixing absent, flag Water/Fire no-go depending on the claim type.
14.3.3.3 Stationarity and reversibility tester for Markov processes
Detect “No Stationary” claims by:
structural classification of chain (transient vs recurrent),
drift/minorization diagnostics,
or explicit stationary defect computation (\Delta_\pi=d(\pi K,\pi)).
Emit FAIL or AMBIG with evidence plan.
14.3.3.4 Minimal witness extraction and quarantine overlay generation for Cloud no-go
Apply deterministic minimal-core extraction to identify the smallest set of assumptions and certificates whose failure causes the no-go. Emit quarantine overlays that prevent downstream OK sealing of inference claims dependent on invalid probabilistic assumptions.
14.3.4 Certificates
14.3.4.1 Probability axiom violation certs (Cloud⊗Earth)
Certify negativity/out-of-range probabilities or additivity violations with minimal witness and deterministic replay.
14.3.4.2 Integrability/measurability violation certs (Cloud⊗Water)
Certify absence of finite mean/variance when required by the claim, or non-measurability of maps used in pushforwards.
14.3.4.3 Process impossibility certs (Cloud⊗Fire)
Certify transient/no-stationary contradictions and entropy-production reversal impossibilities, or provide bounded-cost models when used as repair (then downgrade appropriately).
14.3.4.4 Coherence/phase illegality certs (Cloud⊗Air)
Certify that claims of coherence preservation violate information constraints or decoherence models, or certify admissible additional channels that restore identifiability and permit NEAR/OK.
14.4 Fractal — Scale illegality: false universality, bad RG, and recursion obstructions
14.4.1 Objects
14.4.1.1 Fractal anti-expression schema (recursive/scaling violations)
Fractal anti-expressions encode failures of scale, dimension, and renormalization. The Shadow Crystal enumerates Fractal anti-expressions including forcing integer dimensions, collapsing multifractal spectra, forcing irrational exponents to be rational, forcing complex dimensions to be real, false smoothness, zero-entropy-loss coarse-graining, false RG convergence, false universality, and improper scale inversion.
Definition 14.15 (Fractal anti-expression record). A Fractal anti-expression (\mathrm{AE}(\mathrm{Fractal},e,k)) specifies:
scale ladder objects ((R,P)) and RP/PR consistency requirements,
RG maps (\mathcal R) and fixed-point objects,
observability families and universality suites,
violation predicates for drift, twist, and false equivalence,
repair moves (increase resolution, expand observable set, change corridor, or abstain).
14.4.1.2 Earth in Fractal: forcing discrete structure on inherently fractal objects
Representative anti-expressions include:
forcing fractal sets to have integer dimensions,
forcing irrational exponents to be rational.
These correspond to Earth-type collapse without scale: replacing a scale-dependent spectrum with a single integer descriptor without carrying the scale ladder and its invariants.
14.4.1.3 Water in Fractal: multifractal measure illegality and zero-entropy-loss coarse-graining
Representative anti-expressions include:
“Information Loss: coarse-graining that claims zero entropy loss” (L1),
“False Measure: Hausdorff measure 0 or ∞ treated as finite” (L3).
These are Water-type violations: illegal limit/measure coercions without correct scaling/regularization semantics.
14.4.1.4 Fire/Air in Fractal: bad RG, false universality, false convergence and spectral triples
Representative anti-expressions include:
“Bad RG: renormalization that destroys scale structure,” “False Convergence,” and “False Universality.”
“Scale Inversion: reversing RG flows (fine from coarse) without prior” and “False Triple: spectral triples on fractals treated as manifolds.”
Fire corresponds to dynamical instability of RG (blow-up, bad fixed points). Air corresponds to spectral/representation illegality: imposing manifold spectral structures on fractals without admissibility, or claiming universality where twist defects prove inequivalence.
14.4.2 Calculus
14.4.2.1 Twist and drift as canonical Fractal no-go predicates
Fractal no-go is determined by two primary defect types:
Twist defect (noncommutation of scale change and representation change). If coarse-graining (R) and rotation (T) fail to commute beyond corridor tolerance, universality claims cannot be sealed.
Drift defect (invariant instability under refinement). If invariant signatures drift beyond tightening schedules, claims of fixed points or universality become false.
Both defects are formalized in Chapters 6.4 and 7.4 and are bound by corridor truth (Chapter 4).
14.4.2.2 Earth/Water in Fractal: collapsing spectra and coercing measures
Earth/Water Fractal no-go predicates detect:
collapse of multifractal or scaling spectra into single numbers without scale parameter,
coercion of divergent/undefined measures into finite values,
assertions of “no information loss” under coarse-graining without an explicit information ledger and certified bounds.
These correspond exactly to “collapse without scale” and “bad limit” in a scale-indexed setting.
14.4.2.3 Fire in Fractal: RG blow-up and false convergence
Fire Fractal no-go detects:
claiming RG convergence in finite time without contraction certificates,
mapping critical behavior to trivial fixed points without preserving relevant exponents,
asserting stable recursion where defect energy does not contract.
Violations are proven by lower bounds on contraction factors or by exhibiting invariant drift.
14.4.2.4 Air in Fractal: false universality and representation imposition
Air Fractal no-go detects:
identifying distinct universality classes as one (“False Universality”),
imposing spectral triples/manifold structures on fractals without admissibility,
claiming scale inversion without prior (fine-from-coarse reconstruction without sufficient information).
Air Fractal violations are spectral/representation violations: claiming invertibility and coherent structure where coarse-graining is inherently lossy.
14.4.3 Algorithms
14.4.3.1 Fractal no-go checker: twist/drift/contraction auditing
Algorithm 14.16 (DetectNoGoFractal). Input: multiscale program (P), scale ladder (\mathcal E), corridor (C). Output: PASS/AMBIG/FAIL.
Checks:
RP/PR consistency obligations (representability); missing implies AMBIG.
Twist defect between coarse-grain maps and rotations; large certified lower bounds imply FAIL.
Drift of invariant suites under refinement; drift beyond schedule implies FAIL for universality claims.
Contraction verification for recursive steps; absence implies AMBIG or FAIL depending on claim.
Universality discrimination: compare exponent objects and observable families; mismatch yields FAIL (false universality).
14.4.3.2 Minimal core extraction for multiscale no-go
Identify the smallest set of:
scale steps,
observable choices,
claimed commutations,
missing certificates,responsible for the no-go. Produce a witness core that reproduces twist/drift failure under replay.
14.4.3.3 Quarantine escalation for unstable recursion and false universality
Emit quarantine overlays that:
block OK sealing for universality claims,
block route canonicalization that would reuse false equivalences,
force evidence plans to expand observables or increase resolution,
record explicit repair move sets (tightening schedules, contraction proofs).
14.4.3.4 Repair synthesis: refine observables, add scale parameters, or tunnel
Fractal repairs include:
increasing observability families (\mathcal O_\epsilon),
adding missing RP/PR and contraction certificates,
restricting the claim to a scale window where stability holds,
tunneling to a representation where the twist defect is reduced (representation switch) and then certifying commutation.
14.4.4 Certificates
14.4.4.1 Twist-defect obstruction certs
Certify that no induced coarse action exists or that noncommutation defect exceeds threshold, thereby proving false universality or illegality of the coarse model under the corridor.
14.4.4.2 Drift-boundedness and tightening schedule certs
Certify that invariants remain stable under refinement (PASS) or certify drift beyond budget (FAIL). For PASS, include proof of compliance with tightening schedules.
14.4.4.3 Contraction and recursion safety certs
Certify contraction factors for recursive steps, fixed-point existence, and safety against recursion explosion; lack of these certs prevents OK promotion for Fractal claims.
14.4.4.4 Quarantine and minimal-core certs for Fractal shadow events
Certify that:
false universality and bad RG claims are quarantined,
minimal cores are correctly extracted and replayable,
repair plans are finite and corridor-admissible,
no downstream OK sealing bypasses the quarantine without explicit certified remediation.
14.5 The Shadow Crystal as a kernel primitive: no-go detection is part of semantics
The Shadow Crystal is not auxiliary; it is a semantic boundary condition. The “64 anti-expressions / negative-space lattice” is explicitly defined as a catalogue of impossible operation classes, structured by four elemental failure modes projected through shapes and levels. The canonical no-go types include “crossing a singularity without tunneling” (Water), “infinite energy in finite time” (Fire), and “perfect reconstruction from insufficient data” (Air), which define the formal boundaries of admissibility and the necessity of routing/tunneling as lawful repair.
Every no-go event yields one of:
FAIL with minimal witness and quarantine,
AMBIG with evidence plan and bounded search,
or NEAR/OK only after an admissible repair move is applied and certified under corridor.
CHAPTER 14 — SHADOW CRYSTAL: FAILURE MODES, OBSTRUCTIONS, ILLEGAL MOVES (Addr ⟨0031⟩₄)
Chapter 15 — Router Theory: From FAIL/AMBIG to Certified Paths (Addr ⟨0032⟩₄)
15.1 Square — Route objects, corridor-aware admissibility, and path normal forms
15.1.1 Objects
15.1.1.1 RouteQuery, RouteIntent, and typed endpoints
A route is a certified construction that produces a target semantic relation (dependency closure, transport equivalence, implementation binding, proof binding, migration, conflict isolation) as a composition of kernel edges (Chapter 5) under a corridor policy (Chapter 4).
Definition 15.1 (RouteIntent). RouteIntent is an enum specifying the semantic target:
DEPEND: produce a dependency closure route (REF-induced closure and its certificates),
TRANSPORT: produce a transport route between presentations/objects (DUAL/EQUIV in the rotation groupoid),
REALIZE: produce an implementation realization route (IMPL binding plus tests),
PROVE: produce a proof route (PROOF binding plus checker closure),
MIGRATE: produce a migration route (MIGRATE chain under a monotone versionline),
RESOLVE: produce a conflict resolution route (CONFLICT packet + remediation edges),
TUNNEL: produce a tunnel repair route (legal reroute around a no-go, including chart switches and admissibility refinements).
Definition 15.2 (RouteQuery). A RouteQuery is a tuple:[Q := (\mathrm{Intent},\ \mathrm{Src},\ \mathrm{Dst},\ C,\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{Region},\ \mathfrak I,\ B,\ \mathrm{Constraints}),]where:
Src, Dst are GlobalAddr endpoints (or typed endpoint descriptors),
(C) is the corridor policy identifier (CorridorID),
Scope is INTRA/INTER/EXTERNAL,
Region is the declared admissible region for the route’s semantics (domains, branches, scale windows),
(\mathfrak I) is the invariant suite required to gate admissibility (Chapter 7),
(B) is the budget vector (Chapter 4),
Constraints include required edge kinds, forbidden edge kinds, required intermediate nodes, maximum depth, and admissible transform families.
Definition 15.3 (Typed endpoints). Endpoints are typed to prevent category errors:
DEPEND endpoints are atoms (GlobalAddr of a definition/theorem/algorithm),
TRANSPORT endpoints are presentations or operator objects with RNF metadata (Chapter 3),
REALIZE endpoints include an interface descriptor and artifact spec,
PROVE endpoints include theorem statement hashes and lemma closure descriptors,
TUNNEL endpoints include an explicit no-go witness or trigger pattern from the Shadow Crystal (Chapter 14).
15.1.1.2 Path objects in the MyceliumGraph: node paths, edge paths, and route semantics
Definition 15.4 (Edge path). An edge path is a finite sequence of LinkEdges:[p := (e_1,\ldots,e_m),\qquad e_i\in E(\mathcal G),]such that (\mathrm{Dst}(e_i)=\mathrm{Src}(e_{i+1})) for all (i). The endpoints are (\mathrm{Src}(p)=\mathrm{Src}(e_1)) and (\mathrm{Dst}(p)=\mathrm{Dst}(e_m)).
Definition 15.5 (Node path). A node path is the induced vertex sequence:[v_0\to v_1\to\cdots\to v_m,\qquad v_i=\mathrm{Dst}(e_i).]
Definition 15.6 (Route semantics). A path (p) realizes a RouteIntent if the sequence of edge kinds matches the intent’s admissible grammar and the composite semantics is well-defined:
DEPEND routes realize closure via required REF edges (and required CERT/REPLAY edges under corridor),
TRANSPORT routes realize a morphism in the rotation groupoid via DUAL/EQUIV edges and commuting-diagram witnesses,
REALIZE routes include IMPL binding edges and associated tests,
PROVE routes include PROOF edges and checker results,
MIGRATE routes consist of MIGRATE edges in a single monotone versionline,
RESOLVE routes include CONFLICT edges and remediation edges,
TUNNEL routes include a no-go edge witness and a certified repair sequence that eliminates the trigger under corridor.
A route is not merely a path; it is a path plus admissibility proofs, invariant gates, defect bounds, and replay closure.
15.1.1.3 RouteState, admissibility context, and incremental commitments
Routing proceeds via incremental states capturing partial paths and accumulated obligations.
Definition 15.7 (RouteState). A RouteState is:[S := (v,\ p,\ \mathcal L,\ \mathcal O,\ \mathrm{BudgetUse},\ \mathrm{DefectUse},\ \mathrm{InvarUse},\ \mathrm{Status}),]where:
(v) is the current node,
(p) is the accumulated edge path,
(\mathcal L) is the residual ledger accumulated so far (defects, bounds, risks),
(\mathcal O) is the obligation list accumulated so far,
BudgetUse records cost consumption,
DefectUse records composed defect bounds under corridor algebra,
InvarUse records evaluated invariant signatures and gate outcomes,
Status ∈ {OPEN, PRUNED, AMBIG, FAIL-CANDIDATE, COMPLETE}.
Definition 15.8 (Incremental commitment). A RouteState carries commitments:
canonical normal forms for edges and nodes in the path,
content hashes for all referenced corridor policies,
partial replay commitments for steps already executed in replay mode (when allowed).
Incremental commitments ensure determinism: identical RouteQuery and identical index snapshot must generate identical RouteState expansions and identical tie-break outcomes.
15.1.1.4 Path Normal Form (PNF), route hashes, and canonical representations
To support deterministic caching, comparison, and sealing, each realized route has a canonical normal form.
Definition 15.9 (Path Normal Form). A path is in PNF if:
all nodes and edges are in canonical NF (GlobalAddrNF and LinkEdge NF),
consecutive neutral pairs are eliminated when certified (e.g., inverse transports cancel under admissibility),
non-adjacent lens swaps are factorized into adjacent DUAL sequences when applicable (Flower discipline; see 15.2),
gauge-only detours are removed when corridor permits parity/gauge quotienting (Chapter 9),
all commuting reorders used are justified by commuting-diagram witnesses,
route is serialized deterministically: edge list ordered, with explicit region/branch declarations and corridor IDs attached per edge.
Definition 15.10 (Route hash). The route hash is:[\mathrm{RouteID} := \mathrm{Hash}(\mathrm{PNF}(p)\ \Vert\ \mathrm{PNF}(\mathcal L)\ \Vert\ \mathrm{PNF}(\mathcal O)\ \Vert\ \mathrm{CorridorID}),]and is used as a cache key and as an identifier for sealed route artifacts.
Definition 15.11 (Canonical route witness set). A canonical route witness set is a minimal witness set sufficient to replay the route, verify admissibility, verify invariant gates, and verify all defect bounds needed for corridor truth of the route’s intended claim.
15.1.2 Calculus
15.1.2.1 Path composition, typed concatenation, and domain propagation
Rule 15.12 (Typed concatenation). Two paths (p,q) are concatenable iff (\mathrm{Dst}(p)=\mathrm{Src}(q)) and the RouteIntent grammar permits the concatenation (e.g., a TRANSPORT route may concatenate DUAL/EQUIV edges; a DEPEND route may concatenate required REF dependencies; a mixed route must be explicitly permitted by corridor).
Rule 15.13 (Domain propagation). Every edge (e) carries domain/branch constraints. For a composite path (p=(e_1,\ldots,e_m)), the composite admissible region is:[\mathrm{Region}(p) := \bigcap_{i=1}^m \mathrm{Region}(e_i)\ \cap\ \mathrm{PropagateBranches}(e_1,\ldots,e_m),]where PropagateBranches applies the branch/guard propagation rule from the rotation calculus (Chapter 3). If the intersection is empty or cannot be certified nonempty under corridor, the route is FAIL or AMBIG (depending on decidability).
15.1.2.2 Admissibility predicate, invariant gates, and no-go avoidance
A route is admissible only if it avoids Shadow Crystal triggers and satisfies corridor gates.
Definition 15.14 (Route admissibility predicate). For a RouteQuery (Q) and candidate path (p), define:[\mathrm{Admissible}(p;Q) :=\mathrm{ScopeOK}(p;Q)\ \wedge\ \mathrm{DomainOK}(p;Q)\ \wedge\ \mathrm{NoGoFree}(p;Q)\ \wedge\ \mathrm{GateOK}(p;Q).]Components:
ScopeOK: every edge respects scope constraints and EXTERNAL pins,
DomainOK: branch/guard admissibility holds on declared region,
NoGoFree: no no-go predicate is triggered (Chapter 14) or any triggered predicate is discharged by explicit repair steps,
GateOK: all required invariant suites (Chapter 7) satisfy gating tolerances.
Rule 15.15 (No-go discharge discipline). If a no-go trigger is detected (Earth/Water/Fire/Air), admissibility requires either:
a certified discharge (regularization, domain restriction, added channels, dissipative clamp, scale parameter), or
a reroute that avoids the trigger,otherwise the route is FAIL with minimal witness or AMBIG with evidence plan when discharge depends on missing bounds.
15.1.2.3 Cost algebra and deterministic tie-breaks
Routing is a constrained optimization under corridor budgets.
Definition 15.16 (Cost tuple). Each partial route state has a cost tuple:[\mathrm{Cost}(S) := (\Delta,\ \mathrm{BudgetUse},\ |\mathcal O|,\ |p|,\ \mathrm{LexKey}),]where:
(\Delta) is a certified upper bound on composed defect or a worst-case defect bound,
BudgetUse is corridor budget consumption,
(|\mathcal O|) is number of open obligations,
(|p|) is path length,
LexKey is a deterministic lexical key (edge IDs and node IDs).
Rule 15.17 (Lexicographic minimization). The router selects routes by lexicographically minimizing Cost under corridor constraints, using deterministic tie-break rules:
minimal certified defect bound (\Delta),
minimal budget use,
minimal open obligations (unless corridor explicitly permits obligations at NEAR),
minimal path length,
lexicographically minimal PNF(Route).
Any comparator requiring unavailable data yields AMBIG with an evidence plan to obtain the missing bound or to accept a weaker route classification.
15.1.2.4 Soundness, completeness, and optimality relative to corridor truth
Definition 15.18 (Sound route). A route output is sound if:
the returned path exists in the graph under the index snapshot,
the path is admissible under the corridor,
the intended semantic relation is realized (dependency closure, transport equivalence, implementation binding, proof binding),
all required witnesses and replay artifacts are present and verified.
Definition 15.19 (Complete router). A router is complete for a given intent and corridor class if, whenever a sound route exists within the corridor’s search budgets, the router returns:
a certified route (OK/NEAR), or
an AMBIG outcome containing an evidence plan whose completion yields a certified route or a certified impossibility.
Definition 15.20 (Optimal router). A router is optimal under corridor (C) if it returns a sound route that is minimal under the corridor’s lexicographic cost ordering among all sound routes satisfying the same intent and constraints.
Completeness and optimality are corridor-relative because corridors bound search depth, loop enumeration, and proof budget.
15.1.3 Algorithms
15.1.3.1 Corridor-aware shortest-path router on (\mathcal G)
Algorithm 15.21 (RouteSearch). Input: RouteQuery (Q), graph (\mathcal G), index snapshot (\mathcal I). Output: route outcome in ({\mathrm{OK},\mathrm{NEAR},\mathrm{AMBIG},\mathrm{FAIL}}) with payload.
Search uses uniform-cost search (or A* with admissible heuristic when pinned) over RouteStates:
function RouteSearch(Q, G, I):
init := RouteState(v=Q.Src, p=[], L=[], O=[], BudgetUse=0, DefectUse=0, InvarUse={}, Status=OPEN)
PQ := priority_queue(order=Cost_lex) // deterministic
PQ.push(init)
Best := map from node to best-known cost (deterministic key)
while PQ not empty and within_budget(Q.B):
S := PQ.pop()
if S.Status != OPEN: continue
if S.v == Q.Dst and IntentSatisfied(S, Q):
return SealOrClassify(S, Q, I)
for edge e in OutEdges(S.v) restricted by AllowedKinds(Q):
S2 := ExtendState(S, e, Q, I) // update ledger, obligations, defect bounds
if S2.Status == PRUNED: continue
if dominated(S2, Best): continue
Best.update(S2)
PQ.push(S2)
return AmbigOrFailFromFrontier(PQ, Q, I)
Key subroutines:
AllowedKinds(Q): corridor- and intent-dependent allowed edge kinds,
ExtendState: checks scope legality, updates admissibility constraints, applies invariant gates when available, runs no-go static checks, and generates obligations when missing certificates are detected,
IntentSatisfied: ensures the route grammar matches the intent (e.g., EQUIV/DUAL chain for TRANSPORT),
SealOrClassify: emits OK/NEAR if closure is satisfied, or AMBIG with evidence plan otherwise.
15.1.3.2 Path canonicalization and cache-aware rewriting
Algorithm 15.22 (CanonicalizeRoute). Input: candidate path (p), corridor (C). Output: PNF(p) and equivalence witnesses.
Steps:
Normalize all edges and nodes to NF.
Apply certified cancellation rules (inverse pairs) when round-trip integrity certs exist.
Factor any non-adjacent lens change into adjacent DUAL steps (delegated to Flower module; see 15.2.3.1).
Apply parity/gauge quotienting if corridor permits (Chapter 9): eliminate gauge-only detours under certified gauge-fix.
Rewrite commuting segments only when diagram witnesses exist or can be generated within budget.
Emit PNF and route hash; store cache entry keyed by RouteID and CorridorID.
Canonicalization is deterministic and yields identical PNF for equivalent routes under the corridor’s rewrite system.
15.1.3.3 FAIL/AMBIG core extraction and explanation objects
Algorithm 15.23 (ExplainFailureOrAmbiguity). Input: frontier states, detected no-go triggers, unresolved obligations, corridor. Output: either minimal FAIL witness or AMBIG CandidateSet with evidence plan.
Rules:
If a no-go predicate is certified true (lower bound obstruction), return FAIL with minimal witness core (Chapter 14 minimal witness extraction protocol).
If ambiguity arises from multiple candidate routes within cost tolerance, return AMBIG with CandidateRouteSet and disambiguation obligations.
If ambiguity arises from missing bounds/certificates, return AMBIG with an EvidencePlan specifying minimal tasks to obtain missing data.
Minimal witness extraction uses deterministic pruning over:
the set of premises used to declare admissibility,
the set of edges comprising the candidate route,
the set of certificates used to claim a bound.
15.1.3.4 Route sealing: emitting LinkEdges and route modules
Algorithm 15.24 (SealRoute). Input: route state (S) with path (p), intent (Q.\mathrm{Intent}), corridor (C). Output: new graph artifacts.
Sealing produces different artifacts depending on intent:
DEPEND: a closure artifact + OK closure cert (Chapter 4) and/or module seal (Chapter 5.4),
TRANSPORT: an EQUIV or DUAL edge whose payload includes TransformRef/RegionNF/InvariantSuite/DefectSpec/BudgetNF plus commuting diagram witnesses,
REALIZE: IMPL edge binding spec to implementation plus test suite replays,
PROVE: PROOF edge binding claim to proof artifact and checker outputs,
MIGRATE: MIGRATE edge chain sealed under a monotone versionline,
RESOLVE: CONFLICT edge + remediation edges,
TUNNEL: a repair route sealed as a composite of admissible edges that discharges the no-go predicate and reclassifies the claim.
Sealing requires:
deterministic replay transcripts for all computations used in admissibility and bounds,
witness manifests (minimal witness set),
corridor truth evaluation yielding OK/NEAR for the resulting edge(s).
If sealing prerequisites are incomplete, output is AMBIG with EvidencePlan rather than a partial seal.
15.1.4 Certificates
15.1.4.1 Route soundness cert (intent satisfaction and admissibility)
Certifies that the returned route:
is a valid edge path in the MyceliumGraph under the pinned snapshot,
satisfies the intent grammar (e.g., TRANSPORT path composes into a morphism),
satisfies scope constraints and external pins,
satisfies domain/branch admissibility and no-go avoidance.
The certificate includes:
the path in PNF,
the declared region,
the admissibility predicate decomposition and its proofs/replays.
15.1.4.2 Determinism and tie-break cert (uniqueness under corridor ordering)
Certifies that route selection is deterministic:
identical inputs yield identical output,
all tie-break rules are pinned and applied,
route canonicalization yields a unique PNF representative,or else returns AMBIG with CandidateSet and evidence plan.
15.1.4.3 Budget closure and defect-bound certs (OK/NEAR route classification)
Certifies:
composed defect bound (\Delta) is within corridor tolerances,
uncertainty/approximation terms are fully ledgered (NEAR) and within permitted thresholds,
budget use is within limits,
obligations are closed (OK) or permitted with explicit evidence plans (NEAR/AMBIG).
15.1.4.4 Route sealing cert (LinkEdge correctness, witness sufficiency, replay closure)
Certifies that sealed edges produced from the route:
have correct EdgeIDs and payload commitments,
satisfy sufficiency predicates per Kind (Chapter 5.3.2.2),
are replayable under pinned kernels and randomness policies,
integrate cleanly into dependency closure without violating corridor truth constraints.
15.2 Flower — Routing on the rotation groupoid: commuting diagrams, gauge coherence, and duality constraints
15.2.1 Objects
15.2.1.1 Groupoid routing objects: morphism paths and transport endpoints
For TRANSPORT intent, routes are morphism paths in the rotation groupoid (Chapter 3.2).
Definition 15.25 (Transport route). A transport route is a path whose edge kinds lie in:[{\mathrm{DUAL},\mathrm{EQUIV},\mathrm{MIGRATE}}\ \cup\ {\text{auxiliary REF/PROOF edges used only for closure}},]and whose composite semantics is a transport between presentations with declared regions and branch/gauge data.
Transport endpoints include:
RNF presentations,
transform objects,
invariant suites required for equivalence,
parity/gauge objects when present (Chapter 9).
15.2.1.2 Diagram obligations and commutation witness objects
Definition 15.26 (Diagram obligation). A diagram obligation is a record requiring a commuting square for two alternative factorization paths between the same endpoints, with:
two route words,
an admissible region,
a defect metric and threshold,
required invariants and gauge conventions.
Diagram witnesses produced from obligations are first-class artifacts and are mandatory for any route rewrite that assumes commutation.
15.2.1.3 Gauge-fix and parity-coherence objects as routing constraints
Gauge choices and parity splits constrain which routes are admissible.
Routing constraints may include:
mandatory gauge-fix (unique representative required),
parity commutation requirements ((\chi)-commute constraints),
discrete subgroup constraints for lattice-preserving dualities,
branch coherence constraints for multivalued analytic primitives.
These are encoded as:
admissibility guards at each edge,
required certificates (gauge invertibility, holonomy bounds),
no-go triggers (false unitarity, singular crossing).
15.2.1.4 Holonomy clusters and obstruction objects as route blockers
Cycles in the transport subgraph can carry holonomy and obstructions. These are treated as route blockers under strict corridors:
nonzero holonomy beyond tolerance prevents canonicalization and OK sealing,
obstructions (lower bounds on diagram defects) force FAIL and quarantine.
Holonomy clusters are identified and audited as part of route compilation.
15.2.2 Calculus
15.2.2.1 Adjacent-swap discipline and factorization of lens moves
All lens moves are restricted to adjacent swaps under atlas adjacency (Chapter 1; DUAL discipline).
Rule 15.27 (Adjacent-only transport). Any non-adjacent lens change must be factorized into adjacent DUAL steps. Direct non-adjacent swaps are illegal unless explicitly certified as a derived optimization that preserves admissibility and reduces defect under corridor.
15.2.2.2 Diagram-defect calculus and obstruction propagation
Transport equivalence requires commuting diagrams; noncommutation is treated as defect and can be an obstruction.
Rule 15.28 (Commutation required for rewrites). Any rewrite of a transport route (p) into (p') is admissible only if a commuting diagram witness certifies that the induced transports agree on the declared region within corridor thresholds.
Rule 15.29 (Obstruction propagation). If an obstruction certificate exists for a diagram class, then any route requiring that commutation is blocked and the router must:
reroute through alternative transforms,
restrict the domain to a region where commutation holds,
or return FAIL with obstruction witness.
15.2.2.3 Holonomy constraints and canonical gauge selection
Rule 15.30 (Holonomy-bounded canonicalization). Canonical route selection requires bounded holonomy over pinned loop families. If gauge-fixing is used, holonomy must be bounded to prevent drift in canonical representatives. Failure yields:
AMBIG with evidence plan to refine gauge conventions or domains, or
FAIL with holonomy obstruction when a lower bound is certified.
15.2.2.4 Duality restrictions and discrete subgroup admissibility
Transport routes involving dualities must respect:
unitarity/symplecticity in coherent corridors,
lattice-preserving subgroup constraints in discrete corridors,
parity/gauge coherence constraints.
Violation triggers Air-type no-go and blocks OK sealing unless repaired by domain restriction or set-valued semantics.
15.2.3 Algorithms
15.2.3.1 Factorize and certify lens moves via adjacent DUAL steps
Algorithm 15.31 (FactorizeLensTransport). Input: desired lens swap, corridor. Output: adjacent DUAL sequence and obligations.
Steps:
compute the two adjacent paths on the cyclic lens order,
select canonical path by corridor cost,
validate admissibility (domain/branch/gauge) on declared region,
emit obligations for missing DUAL edges or missing admissibility certificates.
15.2.3.2 Diagram synthesis pass for route equivalence
Algorithm 15.32 (SynthesizeTransportDiagram). Input: two candidate routes between same endpoints. Output: commuting diagram witness or conflict.
Steps:
compile both routes into replayable scripts,
evaluate induced transports on pinned test regime or analytic bound region,
compute diagram defect and compare to thresholds,
emit:
diagram witness (OK/NEAR),
conflict packet (FAIL) when lower bound violates threshold,
evidence plan (AMBIG) when missing prerequisites.
15.2.3.3 Holonomy audit integrated into route selection
Algorithm 15.33 (HolonomyAwareSelect). Input: candidate routes, loop policies, corridor. Output: chosen route or AMBIG.
The selection penalizes routes that traverse holonomy clusters with high measured holonomy or missing holonomy certificates. If a route is chosen that depends on bounded holonomy, the router attaches holonomy certificates as required witnesses.
15.2.3.4 Repair synthesis for transport failures: domain refinement and chart rerouting
When transport fails due to singularities, branch mismatches, or false unitarity, generate repair candidates:
refine domain to exclude singular sets,
insert chart-switch transforms to avoid singularity crossings,
insert parity/gauge fixes to remove gauge-only mismatch,
restrict to invariant subspace where unitarity holds.
Return CandidateSet unless a unique repair is certified under corridor tie-break laws.
15.2.4 Certificates
15.2.4.1 Diagram commutation certs for chosen transport routes
Certify that all commuting square obligations required by the route’s canonicalization are satisfied within corridor thresholds, including admissibility and replay commitments.
15.2.4.2 Symmetry and duality admissibility certs
Certify that:
symmetry actions are preserved or bounded,
gauge-fixing is invertible on the declared region,
discrete subgroup constraints are satisfied where required,
parity commutation constraints hold when applicable.
15.2.4.3 Holonomy-boundedness certs for transport clusters
Certify bounded holonomy for the pinned loop families needed for canonical route selection. Failure yields obstruction or quarantine artifacts.
15.2.4.4 Transport-route canonicalization certs
Certify that the chosen route is the canonical representative under corridor ordering and symmetry quotienting rules, and that alternative routes are equivalent or are explicitly rejected with conflict/obstruction witnesses.
15.3 Cloud — AMBIG resolution: CandidateRouteSets, evidence plans, and uncertainty-aware routing
15.3.1 Objects
15.3.1.1 CandidateRouteSet and probabilistic scoring records
Definition 15.34 (CandidateRouteSet). A CandidateRouteSet is:[\mathcal R := {(p_i,\ s_i,\ \rho_i)}_{i=1}^m,]where (p_i) is a candidate path (in PNF skeleton form), (s_i) is a deterministic score (or distributional score in probabilistic corridors), and (\rho_i) is a justification record listing satisfied/violated constraints and missing certificates.
CandidateRouteSets are mandatory outputs for AMBIG when multiple routes satisfy constraints within uncertainty or when comparators require missing data.
15.3.1.2 EvidencePlan objects for route closure and disambiguation
Definition 15.35 (Routing EvidencePlan). A routing EvidencePlan is a finite program:[\mathrm{EP} := (\mathrm{Tasks},\ \prec,\ \mathrm{StopRules},\ \mathrm{Budget}),]where Tasks include:
compute missing defect bounds (diagram defects, contraction factors, Jacobian bounds),
prove domain admissibility (branch guards, invertibility),
obtain missing external pins,
run replay to validate determinism,
run holonomy audits,
perform identifiability tests for probabilistic components.
StopRules must specify:
promotion conditions (to NEAR/OK route),
failure conditions (obstruction/FAIL),
abstention conditions when budgets are exhausted.
15.3.1.3 Uncertainty ledgers for routing: risk, defect distributions, and missingness
Cloud routing uses uncertainty ledgers to record:
uncertainty in defect bounds (interval bounds, confidence bounds),
uncertainty in admissibility (probabilistic admissibility under noisy measurements),
uncertainty in parameter inference affecting step selection,
risk vectors (tail risk, identifiability risk, model mismatch risk),
dependence/mixing conditions if evidence arises from sampling.
These ledgers map into corridor truth via Chapter 4.
15.3.1.4 Randomness and determinism policies for routing computations
When a corridor permits randomized computations (sampling, Monte Carlo defect estimation), routing must pin:
PRNG algorithm and seed commitments,
random stream schedule,
confidence semantics and composition rules,so that replay determinism is restored at the transcript level (Chapter 5).
15.3.2 Calculus
15.3.2.1 Probabilistic admissibility and chance-constrained routing
In probabilistic corridors, admissibility may be expressed as chance constraints:[\mathbb P(\mathrm{Admissible}(p;Q)) \ge 1-\alpha,]with (\alpha) pinned. Any use of chance constraints requires explicit confidence certificates and tail/mixing assumptions; absent these, outputs remain AMBIG.
15.3.2.2 Conditioning updates: evidence changes route ranking
When new evidence arrives (new certificates, tighter bounds), CandidateRouteSets are updated by conditioning:
infeasible candidates are removed by hard constraints,
scores are recomputed deterministically,
justification records are updated,
promotions/downgrades are performed only by corridor rules.
15.3.2.3 Composition of uncertainty along paths
Uncertainty composes along a path via pinned propagation algebra:
defect bounds accumulate with distortion constants,
confidence failures accumulate conservatively (union bound) unless pinned otherwise,
identifiability constraints propagate: any stage introducing alias cones forces set-valued outcomes unless resolved.
Missing propagation terms force AMBIG.
15.3.2.4 Decision rules: selection, abstention, and value-of-information
A corridor must specify decision rules:
select the route minimizing worst-case certified defect bound,
or select the route maximizing expected utility under pinned priors,
or abstain when ambiguity cannot be resolved within budgets.
Abstention is mandatory when an AMBIG state lacks a terminating evidence plan.
15.3.3 Algorithms
15.3.3.1 Uncertainty-aware route search (robust and stochastic variants)
Algorithm 15.36 (RobustRouteSearch). Search over candidate routes while propagating interval defect bounds and selecting by minimax criteria under corridor.
Algorithm 15.37 (StochasticRouteSearch). When permitted, estimate defect bounds by sampling with pinned randomness; produce confidence intervals and rank candidates by conservative upper bounds.
Both algorithms must emit CandidateRouteSets and EvidencePlans whenever comparisons depend on uncertified estimates.
15.3.3.2 EvidencePlan synthesis for AMBIG routing outcomes
Algorithm 15.38 (SynthesizeRoutingEvidencePlan). Input: AMBIG outcome with missing constraints. Output: minimal EvidencePlan.
Steps:
classify ambiguity sources:
missing admissibility cert (domain/branch/invertibility),
missing defect bounds (diagram/commutator/holonomy),
missing external pins,
multiple near-optimal routes within tolerance,
identifiability ambiguity for parameters.
generate minimal tasks to resolve each source, ordered by dependency:
admissibility before defect optimization,
invariant gates before diagram synthesis,
holonomy audits after gauge-fix selection.
attach stop rules and budget constraints.
15.3.3.3 Candidate-set generation, ranking, and deterministic tie-breaks
Algorithm 15.39 (GenerateCandidateRouteSet). Produce candidate routes by bounded enumeration, filter by invariant signatures, then rank by the corridor’s cost tuple and tie-break law. If ranking requires unknown bounds, retain candidates and attach obligations.
15.3.3.4 NEAR ledger automation and upgrade pipeline for routes
Algorithm 15.40 (RouteUpgradePipeline). Given a NEAR route with open obligations:
monitor for new evidence satisfying obligations,
recompute only affected defect bounds,
if closure predicates become satisfied and ledger terms meet OK thresholds, promote route to OK and seal the corresponding LinkEdges.
All upgrades are emitted as new immutable artifacts referencing prior route payload hashes.
15.3.4 Certificates
15.3.4.1 Evidence plan completeness and termination certs
Certify that an AMBIG routing outcome includes a finite EvidencePlan:
tasks are admissible,
plan terminates within budgets or yields a formal abstention condition,
plan completion is sufficient to decide between OK/NEAR route sealing and FAIL obstruction.
15.3.4.2 Confidence and risk-bound certs for probabilistic routing decisions
Certify confidence semantics for any probabilistic bounds used in route ranking:
tail regime certificates,
mixing certificates for dependent samples,
conservative composition of confidence levels,
mapping into corridor truth.
15.3.4.3 Replay determinism certs for routing computations with randomness
Certify that any randomized routing computation is replayable:
pinned PRNG and stream schedule,
transcript commitments,
stable outputs under replay.
15.3.4.4 Ambiguity/identifiability certs for route-dependent inference
Certify whether route selection depends on unidentifiable parameters; if so, certify set-valued outcomes or enforce abstention until additional observables/certificates are provided.
15.4 Fractal — Multiscale router: tunneling repairs, route lifting, and seed compression
15.4.1 Objects
15.4.1.1 Multiscale RouteQuery: scale ladder, observability level, and twist constraints
A Fractal route query includes scale indexing and observability constraints.
Definition 15.41 (Multiscale RouteQuery). Extend RouteQuery by:[Q^{\Psi} := (Q,\ \mathcal E,\ {R_\epsilon,P_\epsilon},\ {\mathcal O_\epsilon},\ \mathrm{TwistSpec},\ \mathrm{TightenSchedule}),]where:
(\mathcal E) is the scale ladder,
((R_\epsilon,P_\epsilon)) are restriction/prolongation pairs (Chapter 6.4),
(\mathcal O_\epsilon) are observability operators (Chapter 12),
TwistSpec pins noncommutation defect metrics between scale changes and transports,
TightenSchedule pins how tolerances shrink under refinement (Chapter 4.4).
15.4.1.2 Route seeds, module sealing, and expansion closure
Multiscale routes are stored as seeds:
coarse route on quotient/station skeleton,
fiber constraints and observability levels,
propagation bounds across scales,
repair moves used and their certificates,
replay commitments and witness manifests,ensuring idempotent compress/expand.
15.4.1.3 Tunneling repair objects: no-go discharge via chart reroutes
A tunneling repair object is a structured reroute that discharges a Water-type singular crossing or other Shadow Crystal trigger by moving to a chart where the illegal step becomes admissible.
Definition 15.42 (TunnelRepair). A TunnelRepair is:[\mathcal T := (\mathrm{NoGoWitness},\ \mathrm{ChartSwitch},\ \mathrm{RouteWord},\ \mathrm{Region}',\ \mathrm{InvariantSuite},\ \mathrm{DefectSpec},\ \mathrm{Certificates}),]where:
NoGoWitness is the Shadow Crystal witness that blocks the original move,
ChartSwitch is a certified transform sequence to a chart where admissibility holds,
RouteWord is the admissible composite path in the new chart,
Region′ is the refined admissible region,
InvariantSuite and DefectSpec certify that the repaired path preserves required invariants.
For discrete metro/tunneling contexts, tunnel repairs may invoke the quotient/fiber split and snap-cycle mechanisms to replace illegal crossings by certified quotient motion with frozen fiber (Chapters 11–13), expressed as an admissible route in the kernel.
15.4.1.4 Quarantine overlays, recursion budgets, and explosion prevention
Fractal routing includes explicit explosion prevention:
maximum refinement depth,
maximum candidate fiber classes,
maximum loop enumeration for twist/holonomy,
maximum adaptive refinement iterations.
Quarantine overlays block promotion of routes that rely on false universality, unstable recursion, or unbounded twist defects (Chapter 14.4).
15.4.2 Calculus
15.4.2.1 Coarse-to-fine route lifting and projection commutation
A multiscale route is constructed by lifting a coarse route to finer scales.
Rule 15.43 (Route lifting). A coarse route (p_{\epsilon_0}) is liftable to a finer scale (\epsilon_1\prec \epsilon_0) if:
RP/PR consistency holds within tolerance,
the lifted route’s admissible region is nonempty and certified,
twist defect between scale change and transports is within corridor thresholds.
15.4.2.2 Universality gates and scale-indexed equivalence
When a route uses universality equivalence rather than exact equivalence, it must declare:
observable families defining equivalence,
scale-indexed defect tolerances,
contraction certificates justifying irrelevance of discarded degrees,otherwise the route is blocked by Air/Water Fractal no-go predicates (false universality or zero-information-loss coarse-graining).
15.4.2.3 Tightening schedules and route stability under refinement
Refinement tightens tolerances; a route that is NEAR at a coarse scale may FAIL at a finer scale unless:
defect bounds improve under refinement,
additional certificates close,
observability increases to resolve ambiguity.
This is governed by corridor tightening schedules; promotion to OK requires satisfaction across the declared scale window.
15.4.2.4 Route equivalence across scales and seed coherence
Seed coherence requires:
expansion reproduces the same canonical route at each scale,
compress(expand(seed)) is idempotent,
cross-scale drift and twist defects are bounded,
all obligations close or are explicitly tracked.
Noncoherence triggers quarantine and blocks OK sealing.
15.4.3 Algorithms
15.4.3.1 Multiscale router: skeleton-first, then fiber-refine
Algorithm 15.44 (MultiscaleRouteSearch). Input: (Q^{\Psi}). Output: multiscale route seed or AMBIG/FAIL.
Stages:
Skeleton planning: compute a coarse route on quotient/station graph (e.g., (\sigma)-level) using Square router.
Lift: lift the route to refined carriers by adding fiber constraints consistent with observability.
Validate: compute twist defects and invariant drift across scales; generate obligations for missing RP/PR and contraction certificates.
Refine: if route is blocked by ambiguity, increase observability level (k) or refine scale ladder (insert intermediate scales) within budgets.
Seal: when closure predicates hold, seal as a module with witness manifests and replay commitments.
15.4.3.2 Tunneling resolver: transform FAIL/NoGo into an admissible repair route
Algorithm 15.45 (TunnelResolve). Input: a FAIL witness (W) (Water singular crossing, Air false invertibility, etc.), RouteQuery (Q). Output: TunnelRepair candidate set.
Steps:
Identify no-go type and allowed repair moves from the Shadow Crystal record.
Generate candidate chart switches (adjacent lens swaps, chart conjugacy moves, or quotient/fiber decompositions) that avoid the violation predicate.
For each candidate, recompute admissibility and invariant gates; attach required commuting diagram obligations.
Rank candidates deterministically by defect bounds and cost; output:
a unique repair if certified,
else CandidateSet with EvidencePlan.
For snap-driven metro tunneling repairs, the resolver may replace an illegal “crossing” by a certified quotient-step that freezes fiber while changing station, thereby avoiding undefined operations on the forbidden set by restricting the region and using an admissible chart (Chapters 12–13).
15.4.3.3 Adaptive refinement: add scales or observables to close AMBIG
Algorithm 15.46 (AdaptiveRouteRefine). Input: AMBIG route state with evidence plan. Output: refined route attempt or abstention.
Actions:
increase observability level (observe more digits) to reduce fiber ambiguity,
insert intermediate scale levels to reduce twist defects and improve bound propagation,
replace transforms with more stable alternatives (lower distortion constants),
request additional invariants to prune route candidates,all within budgets. If refinement exceeds budgets, return AMBIG with formal abstention condition.
15.4.3.4 Module sealing and regression of route artifacts
Algorithm 15.47 (SealAndRegressRouteModule). Seal the chosen route seed as a module:
emit LinkEdges (EQUIV/DUAL/IMPL/PROOF/GEN/INST) as needed,
emit closure artifacts and certificates,
run regression suite to ensure stability across editions,
emit MIGRATE edges when route artifacts evolve.
15.4.4 Certificates
15.4.4.1 Multiscale route correctness cert (lift, twist bounds, drift bounds)
Certifies:
correctness of coarse route,
validity of lifting across scales,
bounded twist defects between scale changes and transports,
bounded invariant drift under tightening schedule,
closure under corridor truth across the declared scale window.
15.4.4.2 Tunneling repair correctness cert (no-go discharge + invariant preservation)
Certifies that a tunnel repair:
discharges the original no-go predicate (violation no longer applies on refined region),
preserves required invariants under the new chart,
bounds defects introduced by chart switches,
is replayable and closed under corridor policy.
15.4.4.3 Route seed/module integrity cert (compression contract and replay closure)
Certifies:
compression contract: compress(expand(seed)) = seed under pinned policy,
expansion reproduces all required witnesses and replays,
all edge IDs and payload commitments are consistent,
module closure holds under corridor predicates.
15.4.4.4 Explosion-prevention and recursion safety cert for routing
Certifies that:
all recursion and enumeration budgets are enforced,
AMBIG outcomes are produced with terminating evidence plans when bounds are missing,
no unbounded search or refinement occurs,
quarantine overlays are respected and prevent illicit OK sealing of unstable routes.
CHAPTER 15 — ROUTER THEORY: FROM FAIL/AMBIG TO CERTIFIED PATHS (Addr ⟨0032⟩₄)
Part IV — Snap Stabilization, Code Kernel, and Domain Packs (Ch. 16–21)
Chapter 16 — Snap Stabilization: Round-Trip Fixed Points & Alternating Projections
Addr ⟨0033⟩₄Focus: rotate → clamp → rotate-back iteration · defect energies · contraction conditions · upgrade NEAR→OK
16.0 Thesis (what “Snap” is)
A snap stabilizer is a corridor-locking operator built from (i) reversible coordinate changes (“rotations”), (ii) irreversible clamps (projections / proximals / hard constraints), and (iii) a round-trip fixed-point test that tells you whether the clamp sequence has converged to a representation-consistent state.
Formally, you pick a family of constraint sets / gates ({C_j}) and a family of “easy frames” ({R_j}) where each constraint becomes simple. One snap step is:
[x ;\mapsto; T(x) ;:=; \big(R_m^{-1},\mathcal C_m,R_m\big)\circ\cdots\circ\big(R_1^{-1},\mathcal C_1,R_1\big),(x)]
(R_j): a rotation / basis change / chart transform (ideally unitary or well-conditioned).
(\mathcal C_j): a clamp operator (projection (P_{C_j}), proximal map (\mathrm{prox}_{\phi_j}), hard threshold, bandlimit gate, etc.).
Snap state (x_\star): a fixed point (T(x_\star)=x_\star).
Defect (round-trip error): (r(x)=|x-T(x)|), plus per-gate violations.
This chapter makes that precise: what fixed points mean, when iteration converges (contraction / averagedness), how to design defect energies, and how to certify NEAR→OK.
16.1 ■ Square — Local/Discrete Snap (maps, projectors, round-trip residuals)
16.1.1 Formal objects & axioms (Square)
State space. A normed space ((\mathcal X,|\cdot|)) (often (\mathbb R^n), (\mathbb C^n), or (\ell^2(V))).
Round-trip maps. For a forward map (f:X\to Y) and a backward map (g:Y\to X), define the round-trip operator:[\Pi := g\circ f : X\to X]and its zero corridor / fixed set:[Z_X := \mathrm{Fix}(\Pi)={x\in X:\Pi(x)=x}.]This is the precise “where the representation change is lossless” definition.
Clamp operators. A clamp (\mathcal C:\mathcal X\to\mathcal X) is any map meant to enforce a constraint. Canonical example: projection onto a closed set (C),[\mathcal C = P_C(x) := \arg\min_{y\in C}|x-y|.]
Rotate-clamp-rotate-back. A rotated clamp is[\mathcal C^{(R)} := R^{-1}\circ \mathcal C \circ R.]If (R) is unitary and (\mathcal C) is a projection, (\mathcal C^{(R)}) is again a projection onto (R^{-1}(C)).
16.1.2 Invariants & core theorems (Square)
(T1) Fixed-point meaning (round-trip consistency).For any snap operator (T), the “snapped” states are[\mathrm{Fix}(T)={x:;T(x)=x}.]Interpretation: all clamps agree with all chosen frames on (x), i.e., every enforced constraint is already satisfied after every rotation pipeline.
(T2) Projection nonexpansiveness (convex case).If (C\subset\mathcal H) is closed and convex in a Hilbert space, then (P_C) is firmly nonexpansive:[|P_Cx-P_Cy|^2 \le \langle P_Cx-P_Cy,;x-y\rangle.]Consequence: (P_C) is (1)-Lipschitz and “energy-decreasing” in a precise sense.
(T3) Alternating projections (two convex sets).For closed convex (A,B\subset\mathcal H), the iteration[x_{k+1}=P_A P_B x_k]converges (in norm, in many standard settings; in general at least weakly) to a point in (A\cap B) if the intersection is nonempty. If (A\cap B=\varnothing), the sequence converges to a best-approximation pair structure (nearest points) under additional conditions.
(T4) Averaged operator convergence (practical snap condition).If (T) is averaged (i.e., (T=(1-\alpha)I+\alpha S) for some nonexpansive (S) and (\alpha\in(0,1))), then the Krasnosel’skii–Mann relaxation[x_{k+1}=x_k+\lambda_k,(T(x_k)-x_k),\quad \lambda_k\in(0,1)]converges to a fixed point whenever (\mathrm{Fix}(T)\neq\varnothing). This is the main “snap won’t blow up” guarantee used in practice.
16.1.3 Constructions & algorithms (Square)
Algorithm 16.1.A — Generic snap loop (rotate→clamp→rotate-back)
Inputs: (x_0), rotations (R_j), clamps (\mathcal C_j), relaxation (\lambda\in(0,1]), thresholds ((\varepsilon_{\text{OK}},\varepsilon_{\text{NEAR}})).
One snap step[y \leftarrow x;\quad\text{for }j=1..m:; y \leftarrow R_j^{-1}(\mathcal C_j(R_j(y))).]
Relax[x \leftarrow x + \lambda (y-x).]
Measure defects
round-trip residual: (r=|x-y|)
per-gate residuals: (d_j = |R_j(x)-\mathcal C_j(R_j(x))|) (or a domain-appropriate metric)
Stop / classify
OK if (r\le \varepsilon_{\text{OK}}) and (\max_j d_j\le \varepsilon_{\text{OK}})
NEAR if (r\le \varepsilon_{\text{NEAR}}) and (\max_j d_j\le \varepsilon_{\text{NEAR}})
else continue / escalate (change gates, tighten bandlimit, refine resolution, etc.)
This is the “round-trip fixed point” operationalized.
Algorithm 16.1.B — Alternating projections as a snap special case
Take (m=2), (R_1=R_2=I), (\mathcal C_1=P_A), (\mathcal C_2=P_B). Then[T = P_A P_B]and the snap loop is classical alternating projections.
16.1.4 Canonical examples & verification tests (Square)
Example S1 (hard constraints): (C={x:;Mx=b}) affine subspace.Projection is explicit: (P_C(x)=x-M^\top(MM^\top)^{-1}(Mx-b)) (when (M) full row rank).
Example S2 (box clamp): (C=[\ell,u]^n).Clamp is coordinate-wise: ((P_C(x))_i=\min(\max(x_i,\ell_i),u_i)).
Verification suite (Square):
Idempotence check (for true projectors): (|P_C(P_Cx)-P_Cx|) small.
Round-trip shrink: (r_k=|x_{k+1}-x_k|) decreases to (0).
Constraint monotonicity: per-gate violations (d_j(x_k)) should not increase (or should be bounded and trend down under relaxation).
16.2 ❀ Flower — Snap as Rotation Control (unitaries, spectral gates, phase-safe clamps)
16.2.1 Formal objects & axioms (Flower)
Rotations as first-class operators.A “rotation” (R) is ideally unitary (or orthogonal) on a Hilbert space: (R^*R=I). In spectral practice, these include Fourier / eigenbasis transforms.
Spectral clamps.A canonical Flower-clamp is a bandlimit projector:[\mathcal P_{\le \Lambda}(x)=\sum_{\lambda_k\le \Lambda}\langle x,\phi_k\rangle \phi_k](i.e., kill high modes). This is exactly the “low-band corridor” gate used to enforce “same physics” windows in the broader framework.
Rotate→clamp→rotate-back becomes diagonal editing.If (R) diagonalizes some structure, then clamping in the (R)-frame edits only the intended degrees of freedom (modes), instead of creating messy cross-talk in the original coordinates.
16.2.2 Invariants & core theorems (Flower)
(T5) Conjugation preserves Lipschitz constants under unitary rotations.If (R) is unitary and (\mathcal C) is (L)-Lipschitz, then (R^{-1}\mathcal C R) is also (L)-Lipschitz.
(T6) Spectral gate decreases a spectral defect energy.Define spectral energy outside the corridor:[E_{\text{hi}}(x)=| (I-\mathcal P_{\le\Lambda})x|^2.]Then after gating: (E_{\text{hi}}(\mathcal P_{\le\Lambda}x)=0), and for relaxed snaps, (E_{\text{hi}}(x_{k+1})\le E_{\text{hi}}(x_k)) whenever the only modification in the step is replacing (x) with its low-band component.
(T7) Phase-safe stabilization.When “clamps” are phase-sensitive (e.g., enforcing magnitude constraints while retaining phase), stability depends on whether the clamp is nonexpansive in the chosen metric. Practically: choose clamps that are projections in a norm where the rotation is unitary.
16.2.3 Constructions & algorithms (Flower)
Algorithm 16.2.A — Spectral snap (diagonal gate + inverse rotation)
Rotate: (\hat x \leftarrow R x)
Clamp: (\hat x \leftarrow \mathrm{Clamp}(\hat x))Examples: hard bandlimit, soft threshold, phase-locking, magnitude cap.
Rotate back: (x \leftarrow R^{-1}\hat x)
Track leakage: (|(I-\mathcal P_{\le\Lambda})x|) and phase drift (domain-specific).
This is the cleanest instance of “rotate→clamp→rotate-back”.
16.2.4 Canonical examples & verification tests (Flower)
Spectral denoise: (R=) FFT, clamp = soft threshold on high frequencies.
Graph spectral smoothing: (R=) graph Fourier transform (Laplacian eigenvectors), clamp = truncate high eigenmodes.
Verification: energy preservation in the passband, suppression of out-of-band energy, and reduction of the round-trip residual (r).
16.3 ☁ Cloud — Snap under Uncertainty (defect energies, stochastic clamps, NEAR→OK as confidence upgrade)
16.3.1 Formal objects & axioms (Cloud)
Defect energies as objective functions.Given constraints ({C_j}), define a defect energy[E(x)=\sum_{j=1}^m w_j, d(x,C_j)^2](where (d) is a distance or a divergence).
Noisy clamps.A clamp may be stochastic (e.g., Monte-Carlo estimate of a projection). Then (T) becomes random:[x_{k+1}=T_{\omega_k}(x_k).]
NEAR/OK as statistical predicates.
Deterministic: “OK if residual (\le \varepsilon)”.
Stochastic: “OK if residual (\le \varepsilon) with high confidence”, e.g.[\mathbb P(r(x)\le\varepsilon_{\text{OK}})\ge 1-\delta.]
16.3.2 Invariants & core theorems (Cloud)
(T8) Structural vs stochastic residual split.A critical rule (also used elsewhere in the framework) is: if residual plateaus and does not shrink with averaging, it’s structural (not noise). This is the practical meaning of “anti-symmetry vs noise”.
(T9) Expected descent under unbiased stochastic projections (sketch).If each stochastic clamp is an unbiased estimator of a firmly nonexpansive map and variance is controlled, then expected defect energies decrease:[\mathbb E[E(x_{k+1})] \le \mathbb E[E(x_k)] - c,\mathbb E[r(x_k)^2] + \text{(variance term)}.]This gives a precise place where “more samples” upgrades NEAR→OK: you reduce the variance term until the structural term dominates.
16.3.3 Constructions & algorithms (Cloud)
Algorithm 16.3.A — NEAR→OK upgrade protocol
Maintain three ledgers per iteration:
Structural residual: (\widehat r_k = |x_k - \mathbb E[T(x_k)]|) (estimated)
Stochastic spread: (\widehat\sigma_k^2 = \mathrm{Var}(T(x_k))) (estimated)
Defect energy: (E_k)
Upgrade rule:
If (\widehat r_k) is below threshold and (\widehat\sigma_k) is also below threshold, promote NEAR→OK.
If (\widehat r_k) is small but (\widehat\sigma_k) is large: “NEAR but noisy” → increase samples / variance reduction.
If (\widehat r_k) is not small and (\widehat\sigma_k) is small: “structural obstruction” → change gates / rotations / corridor definition.
16.3.4 Canonical examples & verification tests (Cloud)
Bootstrap snap test: run (B) stochastic snap trajectories; compute CI for final residual.
A/B clamp stress test: change clamp order and check whether outcomes differ beyond uncertainty—if yes, you’re seeing path dependence (Fractal lens).
16.4 ✶ Fractal — Snap as Alternating Projections to an Intersection (meta-zero, contraction, holonomy control)
16.4.1 Formal objects & axioms (Fractal)
Intersection target.Snap is fundamentally “projection to an intersection corridor”. Let corridors (constraint sets) be (\mathcal Z_1,\dots,\mathcal Z_m). A single composite step is[T := P_{\mathcal Z_m}\cdots P_{\mathcal Z_1}.]
Meta-zero snap operator (canonical form).The broader framework explicitly constructs a stacked gate and iterates it to a fixed point:[\psi_\star := \lim_{k\to\infty} (T)^k \psi,]where (T) is a product of corridor gates (bandlimit, representability, low-band alignment, spin-kill, etc.).
This is exactly “alternating projections” generalized to multiple, noncommuting constraints.
16.4.2 Invariants & core theorems (Fractal)
(T10) Convergence by contraction (hard guarantee).If (T) is a contraction: (|T(x)-T(y)|\le q|x-y|) with (q<1), then the fixed point exists uniquely and iteration converges geometrically:[|x_k-x_\star|\le q^k|x_0-x_\star|.]
(T11) Convergence by averagedness (soft guarantee, common case).Even if (T) is not a contraction, if it is averaged (or becomes averaged after relaxation), fixed-point iteration converges when the fixed set is nonempty.
(T12) Holonomy / order-sensitivity is a measurable defect.Because (P_{\mathcal Z_i}) generally do not commute, different gate orders yield different (T), and the loop residual[\mathrm{Hol}(x)=x - (P_{\mathcal Z_2}P_{\mathcal Z_1})(P_{\mathcal Z_1}P_{\mathcal Z_2})x]quantifies the “twist” (path dependence). Snap stabilization is partly about choosing gates and rotations so this defect shrinks—i.e., making the corridor intersection “less curved”.
16.4.3 Constructions & algorithms (Fractal)
Algorithm 16.4.A — Alternating projections with adaptive corridor tightening
Start with coarse corridors (\mathcal Z_i^{(0)}) (wide tolerances).
Iterate (x_{k+1}=T^{(k)}(x_k)) with (T^{(k)}=\prod_i P_{\mathcal Z_i^{(k)}}).
If residual decreases stably, tighten: (\mathcal Z_i^{(k+1)} \subset \mathcal Z_i^{(k)}).
If residual stalls, either:
relax (bigger (\lambda) damping, or averaged update),
reorder gates to reduce holonomy,
refine scale (multilevel snap: coarse→fine).
This is the “Fractal” nature: snap is not one projection; it’s a hierarchy of projections with progressive tightening.
16.4.4 Canonical examples & verification tests (Fractal)
Multi-gate corridor lock (the explicit design pattern):bandlimit → representability → low-band alignment → spin-kill (then repeat)This is the “rotate/clamp” stack specialized to the four-corner crystal: you first remove aliasing, then enforce representability, then enforce “same physics” band, then damp holonomy.
Convergence plots:(r_k=|x_{k+1}-x_k|), per-gate violations, and holonomy estimates. The goal is to show NEAR→OK as a phase change in these curves: residual becomes monotone, variance shrinks, and holonomy collapses.
16.5 The NEAR→OK Upgrade Rule (single compact statement)
A snap pipeline upgrades NEAR→OK when all three are true:
Fixed-point residual is small: (r(x)=|x-T(x)|\le \varepsilon_{\text{OK}}).
Constraint defects are small: (\max_j d_j(x)\le \varepsilon_{\text{OK}}).
Order/loop instability is small: the holonomy / order-sensitivity is below tolerance (empirically via reordering tests, or analytically by commutator/averagedness bounds).
This is the mathematical core of “round-trip fixed point & alternating projections”: you don’t declare success because one representation looks good; you declare success because the round trip becomes (approximately) the identity on your declared corridor.
Chapter 17 — Kernel Implementation: Data Models, IDs, Serialization (Addr ⟨0100⟩₄)
17.1 Square — Deterministic records: Atom, LinkEdge, Registry, Snapshot
17.1.1 Objects
17.1.1.1 Atom schema: identity, content, obligations, renderings
An Atom is the smallest addressable manuscript object stored in the kernel. Atom identity is content-independent (GlobalAddr), while Atom commitments are content-addressed (hashes) to support replay, regression, and immutability.
AtomNF (canonical record).[\mathrm{Atom} := (\mathrm{Addr},\ \mathrm{AtomKind},\ \mathrm{Header},\ \mathrm{Body},\ \mathrm{Deps},\ \mathrm{Obligations},\ \mathrm{Artifacts},\ \mathrm{PolicyRefs},\ \mathrm{Commits},\ \mathrm{AtomVer})]with fields:
Addr: GlobalAddrNF (Chapter 1).
AtomKind: closed enum describing semantic role:[{\mathrm{DEF},\mathrm{THM},\mathrm{ALG},\mathrm{CERT},\mathrm{PROOF},\mathrm{EDGE},\mathrm{MODULE},\mathrm{INDEX},\mathrm{NOTE}}.]
Header: fixed metadata required for deterministic routing and extraction:
LensLabel ∈ {Square, Flower, Cloud, Fractal}
FacetLabel ∈ {Objects, Calculus, Algorithms, Certificates}
LocalPathID (chapter/section indices)
Scope flags (INTRA/INTER/EXTERNAL)
Schema tags (e.g., “RNF”, “PNF”, “VNF”)
Body: the canonical semantic payload in one of the allowed body types:
StatementNF (typed statement AST or normalized statement bytes)
AlgorithmNF (typed pseudocode / procedure spec)
CertificateNF (typed certificate record)
IndexNF (structured index records)
ModuleNF (sealed module manifest)Exactly one BodyType is primary; others may exist only as renderings.
Deps: explicit dependency references (RefNF tuples) required for closure.
Obligations: obligation list entries (Chapter 4), each content-addressed.
Artifacts: pointers to external/internal artifacts (proof objects, tests, datasets, compiled binaries) using pinned fingerprints.
PolicyRefs: corridor policy identifiers (CorridorID) and kernel IDs required to interpret the atom.
Commits: content commitments:
StatementHash / BodyHash
HeaderHash
DepsHash / ObligationsHash / ArtifactsHash
AtomCommit (defined in 17.1.1.3)
AtomVer: schema version for AtomNF.
Atom immutability rule. Atoms are immutable at the commitment layer: any change to Header/Body/Deps/Obligations/Artifacts produces a new AtomCommit; Addr remains stable only if semantics are preserved (otherwise a MIGRATE record is required).
17.1.1.2 LinkEdge encoding: canonical header, payload, and pointer commitments
A LinkEdge is the only legal mechanism for meaning transfer in the MyceliumGraph (Chapter 5). Kernel encoding makes LinkEdge tamper-evident and replay-verifiable.
LinkEdgeNF (canonical record).[\mathrm{LinkEdge} := (\mathrm{EdgeID},\ \mathrm{Kind},\ \mathrm{Src},\ \mathrm{Dst},\ \mathrm{Scope},\ \mathrm{CorridorID},\ \mathrm{WitnessPtr},\ \mathrm{ReplayPtr},\ \mathrm{Payload},\ \mathrm{EdgeVer})]where:
Kind is from the closed basis:[{\mathrm{REF},\mathrm{EQUIV},\mathrm{MIGRATE},\mathrm{DUAL},\mathrm{GEN},\mathrm{INST},\mathrm{IMPL},\mathrm{PROOF},\mathrm{CONFLICT}}.]
WitnessPtr and ReplayPtr are pointer manifests (17.1.1.4).
Payload is kind-typed and must validate against the payload schema for Kind.
Edge header commitment. The header includes commitments to the witness and replay manifests, not only their pointers:
WitnessCommit = Hash(WitnessManifestNF)
ReplayCommit = Hash(ReplayManifestNF)These commits are included in EdgeID computation to prevent silent swapping of witnesses/replays without changing identity.
17.1.1.3 ID objects: GlobalAddrNF, StatementHash, AtomCommit, EdgeID, SnapshotID, ModuleID
The kernel separates naming (addresses) from commitment (hash IDs).
GlobalAddrNF. Content-independent identity used for human and machine routing.
BodyHash. Content hash of the canonical body bytes:[\mathrm{BodyHash} := \mathrm{H}\big(\mathrm{CanonBytes}(\mathrm{BodyNF})\big).]
AtomCommit. Content-addressed commitment to the full atom:[\mathrm{AtomCommit} := \mathrm{H}\Big(\mathrm{CanonBytes}(\mathrm{AtomHeaderNF})\ \Vert\ \mathrm{BodyHash}\ \Vert\ \mathrm{DepsHash}\ \Vert\ \mathrm{ObligationsHash}\ \Vert\ \mathrm{ArtifactsHash}\ \Vert\ \mathrm{PolicyHashSet}\Big).]AtomCommit is not the address; it is the replay anchor for regression and sealing.
EdgeID. Content-addressed commitment to an edge:[\mathrm{EdgeID}:=\mathrm{H}\big(\mathrm{HdrNF}(\mathrm{LinkEdge})\ \Vert\ \mathrm{PayloadHash}\big),]where HdrNF includes Kind/Src/Dst/Scope/CorridorID/EdgeVer plus WitnessCommit/ReplayCommit, and PayloadHash = H(CanonBytes(PayloadNF)).
SnapshotID. A snapshot is a sealed view of a corpus state:[\mathrm{SnapshotID}:=\mathrm{H}\big(\mathrm{CanonBytes}(\mathrm{SnapshotManifestNF})\big),]where SnapshotManifestNF contains sorted inventories of AtomCommits and EdgeIDs plus corridor and kernel identifiers.
ModuleID. A module is a sealed subgraph (Chapter 5.4):[\mathrm{ModuleID}:=\mathrm{H}\big(\mathrm{CanonBytes}(\mathrm{ModuleManifestNF})\big),]including exports/imports, closure rules, policy set, and SeedCommit.
Hash identifier. All hashes are expressed as:[\mathrm{Digest} := (\mathrm{HashAlgID},\ \mathrm{DigestBytes}),]with HashAlgID pinned (e.g., “BLAKE3-256”, “SHA-256”) and DigestBytes length fixed by HashAlgID. HashAlgID is always committed into manifests and certificates to prevent cross-algorithm ambiguity.
17.1.1.4 Pointer objects: CASRef, WitnessPtr, ReplayPtr, ExternalPin
The kernel treats “everything as content-addressed blobs” and layers typed pointers over it.
CASRef.[\mathrm{CASRef}:=(\mathrm{Digest},\ \mathrm{ObjType},\ \mathrm{ByteLen})]where ObjType is a closed enum (AtomNF, LinkEdgeNF, ProofArtifact, TestArtifact, Dataset, Transcript, Index, Module, Seed, etc.). ByteLen is committed to prevent truncation attacks.
WitnessPtr.[\mathrm{WitnessPtr}:=(\mathrm{WitnessID},\ \mathrm{WitnessManifest}),]where WitnessManifest is a sorted list of CASRefs with witness roles:[(\mathrm{Role},\mathrm{CASRef})]Role ∈ {PROOF-ART, TEST-ART, DIFF-ART, RL-ART, MWS-ART, DIAG-ART, HOL-ART, PIN-ART}.
ReplayPtr.[\mathrm{ReplayPtr}:=(\mathrm{ReplayID},\ \mathrm{KernelID},\ \mathrm{NFConfigID},\ \mathrm{ScheduleNF},\ \mathrm{InputsNF},\ \mathrm{Commitments},\ \mathrm{OutputsNF},\ \mathrm{ExitStatusNF})]with deterministic transcript commitments. If randomness is allowed, the randomness policy and seed commitments are embedded in InputsNF and committed.
ExternalPin.[\mathrm{ExternalPin}:=(\mathrm{ExtKind},\ \mathrm{LocatorNF},\ \mathrm{Fingerprint},\ \mathrm{RetrievalPolicy},\ \mathrm{TimestampPolicy})]and Fingerprint is a Digest. Any EXTERNAL dependency without a valid ExternalPin is invalid for OK/NEAR corridors.
17.1.2 Calculus
17.1.2.1 Canonical Normal Form (NF): idempotent, byte-stable, compositional
All kernel objects admit a canonical normal form whose encoding is deterministic and idempotent.
Definition 17.1 (NF operator). NF is a total function on well-typed kernel objects:[\mathrm{NF}:\mathcal O \to \mathcal O_{\mathrm{NF}}]such that:
Idempotence: (\mathrm{NF}(\mathrm{NF}(x))=\mathrm{NF}(x)).
Deterministic ordering: all unordered collections are sorted by pinned keys (lex order of GlobalAddrNF / EdgeID / Digest as appropriate).
Explicit defaults: omitted fields are forbidden in NF; every optional field is either absent by schema or present with explicit “none” representation pinned by schema.
Stable numeric encoding: integers encoded minimally; floats are either forbidden in commitments or canonicalized under pinned rules (17.2.1.1).
Scope closure: all references embedded in NF must be absolute (GlobalAddrNF) or explicit ExternalPins.
Definition 17.2 (CanonBytes). CanonBytes(x) is the canonical byte serialization of NF(x) under a pinned canonical encoding (17.1.2.2). CanonBytes is the only permitted input to hashing for identity commitments.
17.1.2.2 Hash calculus: commitments, Merkleization, and collision discipline
Hashing is not “checksums”; it is a semantic commitment discipline.
Definition 17.3 (Commitment). A commitment is a Digest computed from CanonBytes of a normal form object. No commitment may be computed over non-normalized representations.
Definition 17.4 (Merkle closure). A manifest (M) is merkle-closed if every referenced CASRef digest appears in the content store and the manifest’s digest commits to the complete set of transitive dependencies:[\mathrm{MerkleClose}(M) = {\text{all CASRefs reachable from }M}.]Module manifests and snapshot manifests must be merkle-closed for OK sealing.
Rule 17.5 (Collision discipline). A corridor policy may require:
collision-resistant HashAlgID,
Digest length thresholds,
dual-hash commitments for high-stakes seals (optional), expressed as a pair of independent digests.Any weakening must be explicit and reflected in corridor truth.
17.1.2.3 Schema evolution: versioning, migrations, and backward compatibility
Schemas evolve without mutation via versioning and explicit migration edges.
Rule 17.6 (Schema versioning).
AtomVer and EdgeVer are monotonically increasing schema version tags.
CanonBytes includes AtomVer/EdgeVer in the committed header so objects are never ambiguous across schema versions.
Parsers must reject unknown schema versions unless explicitly permitted by corridor.
Rule 17.7 (Semantic vs structural migration).
Structural migration: representation changes with identical semantics → allowed via MIGRATE edges with proof of equivalence of meaning and preserved GlobalAddr mapping.
Semantic change: meaning changes → requires either a new GlobalAddr or explicit CONFLICT/branching semantics; reusing the same GlobalAddr without MIGRATE is illegal under strict corridors.
Rule 17.8 (Backward resolution policy). If corridors permit alias resolution across editions, the mapping is mediated by MIGRATE edges pinned to a MonotoneLineID, and all resolution is recorded in closure artifacts.
17.1.2.4 Integrity constraints: immutability, uniqueness, closure, and replay anchoring
Kernel correctness is defined by invariants enforced by validators and certificates.
Invariant 17.9 (Immutability). Objects in the content store are immutable: Digest → bytes mapping never changes. Updates create new digests.
Invariant 17.10 (Address uniqueness). No two atoms may share the same GlobalAddrNF within the same edition without explicit versionline semantics; collisions are quarantined and require resolution moves (MIGRATE, rename, or split).
Invariant 17.11 (Closure). For an OK claim, the closure graph induced by required dependencies contains no unresolved internal references and contains pinned ExternalPins for EXTERNAL references.
Invariant 17.12 (Replay anchoring). Any OK/NEAR claim that depends on computation must cite ReplayPtrs whose KernelID/NFConfigID/ScheduleNF are pinned and whose transcript commitments match OutputsNF. Non-replayable computations are inadmissible for OK in strict corridors.

17.2 Flower — Symmetry of encoding: canonicalization under equivalence, chart changes, and refactors
17.2.1 Objects
17.2.1.1 Canonical encoding rules for ordered vs unordered structures
Kernel objects contain a mix of inherently ordered structures (arrays, transcripts) and unordered structures (sets, maps, postings). Flower-layer encoding insists that symmetry of unordered structures is factored out by NF, while ordered semantics remain explicit.
Definition 17.22 (Order semantics).
Arrays are ordered; their order is committed.
Sets are unordered; NF sorts deterministically by pinned key.
Maps are unordered; CanonBytes encodes maps in canonical key order.
Definition 17.23 (Numeric canonicality).
Integers: minimal-length encoding, exact.
Floats: either forbidden in commitments, or encoded under pinned canonical float rules:
canonical NaN representation,
no platform-dependent extended precision,
explicit rounding mode pinned in KernelID if floats are committed.
These constraints prevent “serialization holonomy” across language runtimes.
17.2.1.2 StatementNF / ASTNF objects and alpha-equivalence boundaries
Statements often contain binders and syntactic variation (alpha-renaming, commutative reordering). The kernel distinguishes:
semantic equivalence (requires EQUIV edges and proofs),
canonical equivalence (safe rewriting that preserves semantics by construction).
Definition 17.24 (ASTNF). ASTNF is a canonical form for statement ASTs that pins:
binder naming normalization (alpha-normal form),
commutative node ordering for commutative operators when corridor declares them commutative,
associative flattening when corridor declares associativity,
explicit parentheses/precedence normalization.
ASTNF is a representation-level choice; it does not replace semantic proofs. If a corridor cannot certify commutativity/associativity for an operator in the relevant domain, ASTNF must not reorder that operator.
17.2.1.3 TransformRef, NormalFormMap, and encoding of transport semantics
Equivalence and transport edges carry TransformRef objects; these must be encoded so that:
transform identity is pinned (TransformID),
admissible region and branch declarations are committed,
induced normal-form translation maps are stored as NormalFormMap artifacts when used for automated rewriting.
Definition 17.25 (NormalFormMap). A NormalFormMap is a typed artifact:[\mathrm{NFMap}:=(\mathrm{SrcNFType},\ \mathrm{DstNFType},\ \mathrm{RewriteRulesNF},\ \mathrm{Admissibility},\ \mathrm{WitnessPtr},\ \mathrm{ReplayPtr})]and is referenced by EQUIV edges when normal-form translation is used to certify operational equivalence.
17.2.1.4 Commuting diagrams for encode/decode and refactor invariance
Flower treats encoding itself as a morphism and requires commuting properties when refactors occur.
Define:
Encode: object → CanonBytes
Decode: CanonBytes → object
Normalize: object → NF(object)
The essential commutations:[\mathrm{Decode}(\mathrm{Encode}(\mathrm{NF}(x))) = \mathrm{NF}(x),\qquad\mathrm{NF}(\mathrm{Decode}(\mathrm{Encode}(x))) = \mathrm{NF}(x),]on all admissible objects. These are certified by round-trip test artifacts and are mandatory for OK corridors.
17.2.2 Calculus
17.2.2.1 Encode/Decode isomorphism discipline and admissible partiality
Encode/Decode is only guaranteed on well-typed objects within schema.
Rule 17.26 (Partiality).
Decode is partial: invalid bytes must fail deterministically with localization.
Encode is total on NF objects.
A kernel must never “auto-correct” invalid bytes into an object; it must return FAIL and require explicit migration.
17.2.2.2 Commutation of canonicalization with composition and hashing
Hash commitments must be independent of evaluation order.
Rule 17.27 (Hash commutation).[\mathrm{H}(\mathrm{CanonBytes}(x)) = \mathrm{H}(\mathrm{CanonBytes}(\mathrm{NF}(x))),]since CanonBytes is defined on NF(x). Therefore, hashing is invariant under any computation path that yields the same NF(x). This rule makes the kernel robust against internal refactor of builders.
17.2.2.3 Symmetry boundaries: what NF may erase vs what requires EQUIV
NF is allowed to erase only representation symmetry that is declared semantically irrelevant by schema:
key ordering in maps,
ordering of sets,
alpha-renaming of bound variables only if binder semantics are preserved.
NF may not erase:
semantic differences between distinct proofs,
semantic differences between distinct domains,
branch differences for multivalued primitives,
corridor policy differences.Those require explicit EQUIV/MIGRATE edges with witnesses.
17.2.2.4 Serialization holonomy: drift detection across runtimes
Holonomy arises when two encoders produce distinct CanonBytes for “the same” logical object due to unpinned choices (float rounding, Unicode normalization, map iteration order). The kernel treats this as a coherence defect:
strict corridors: FAIL and quarantine,
relaxed corridors: NEAR with explicit ledger and forced canonicalization patch.
17.2.3 Algorithms
17.2.3.1 AST canonicalization (alpha-normalization, commutative sorting, associative flattening)
Algorithm 17.28 (ASTNF). Input: typed AST, corridor commutativity/associativity declarations. Output: ASTNF.
Steps:
Alpha-normalize binders: rename bound variables by deterministic de Bruijn or canonical name scheme.
For declared commutative operators: sort children by hash of sub-ASTNF.
For declared associative operators: flatten nested nodes and then sort/group as permitted.
Preserve domain/branch annotations as first-class nodes; never drop them.
Emit ASTNF and StatementHash = H(CanonBytes(ASTNF)).
17.2.3.2 CanonBytes encoder: canonical map ordering and numeric encoding
Algorithm 17.29 (CanonBytesEncode). Input: NF object. Output: bytes.Rules (pinned):
maps encoded with keys sorted; keys restricted to canonical key types (unsigned ints or canonical strings),
arrays preserve order,
integers minimal encoding,
floats either forbidden or canonicalized,
no indefinite-length encodings,
no duplicate keys.
17.2.3.3 Round-trip witness generation for encoding and NF
Algorithm 17.30 (EncodeDecodeWitness). Generate witness artifacts:
encode(NF(x)) → bytes,
decode(bytes) → x′,
assert NF(x′)=NF(x),
produce transcript and hash commitments.
This witness is mandatory for any kernel upgrade that changes serialization code.
17.2.3.4 Symmetry-aware caching keyed by NF and corridor
Cache keys are:[(\mathrm{CorridorID},\ \mathrm{KernelID},\ \mathrm{NFConfigID},\ \mathrm{StatementHash},\ \mathrm{RouteID}/\mathrm{EdgeID})]to prevent cross-policy contamination. Any cache hit must be validated by commitments; otherwise treated as corruption.
17.2.4 Certificates
17.2.4.1 Encode/Decode round-trip cert
Certifies that Encode and Decode commute with NF for all kernel object classes and schema versions in scope, including stress tests for:
boundary integers,
Unicode normalization (if strings are admitted),
forbidden float cases,
large maps and sets.
17.2.4.2 ASTNF equivalence cert under declared algebraic laws
Certifies that ASTNF transformations preserve the semantics declared by the corridor (commutativity/associativity conditions and their admissibility domains). If algebraic laws are conditional, ASTNF must carry those conditions and the cert must prove they hold on the declared domain.
17.2.4.3 Holonomy boundedness cert for multi-runtime serialization
Certifies that canonical encoders across target runtimes (languages/platforms) produce identical CanonBytes for the same NF inputs, or else yields a localized holonomy defect and a mandated migration path.
17.2.4.4 Refactor invariance cert for kernel upgrades
Certifies that refactoring kernel code does not change:
AtomCommit for unchanged atoms,
EdgeID for unchanged edges,
SnapshotID for unchanged manifests,
replay transcript hashes for unchanged schedules,unless explicitly introduced as a schema migration with MIGRATE edges.
17.3 Cloud — Storage, reliability, access control, and tamper-evidence under uncertainty
17.3.1 Objects
17.3.1.1 Content-addressed storage (CAS) and object stores
Cloud layer models the physical persistence and retrieval of CAS objects.
Definition 17.31 (CAS store). A CAS store is a partial function:[\mathrm{CAS}:\mathrm{Digest}\rightharpoonup \mathrm{Bytes},]with the invariant that if CAS(d)=b then H(b)=d (under pinned HashAlgID). Stores may be sharded; shard mapping is deterministic and content-derived (e.g., prefix partitioning), and is part of KernelID.
17.3.1.2 Append-only transparency log and audit trail
Definition 17.32 (Transparency log). An append-only log records:
published SnapshotIDs / ModuleIDs,
their manifests’ digests,
signatures and timestamps (if used),
revocation records for compromised keys (if any).
The log is not required to be confidential; it is required to be tamper-evident and replayable.
17.3.1.3 External pin resolution objects and time-sensitive retrieval
ExternalPin retrieval is inherently time-dependent; Cloud layer records uncertainty explicitly.
Definition 17.33 (External pin resolver). A resolver is:[\mathrm{ResolveExt}:(\mathrm{ExternalPin})\to (\mathrm{Bytes},\mathrm{ResolveTranscript})]where ResolveTranscript commits to retrieval procedure, headers, and validation steps. TimestampPolicy indicates whether the retrieval is time-fixed or time-variable; only time-fixed pins are admissible for strict OK corridors.
17.3.1.4 Failure and threat model objects
Cloud layer defines explicit failure modes:
bitrot (digest mismatch),
partial availability (missing CAS objects),
split-brain registries (inconsistent views),
replay environment drift,
adversarial tampering.
Each mode maps to:
detection procedure,
quarantine trigger,
repair move set (replication repair, re-fetch external pins, rebuild snapshot).
17.3.2 Calculus
17.3.2.1 Probabilistic integrity and redundancy calculus
Reliability is expressed as probability of undetected corruption. Digest verification drives detection; redundancy drives correction.
Rule 17.34 (End-to-end integrity). Any Get operation must verify digest. Without verification, the retrieved bytes are inadmissible for any corridor claim.
Rule 17.35 (Redundancy policy). Replication factor and erasure coding parameters are corridor-independent storage policies but must be pinned in KernelID for reproducibility of performance claims and to interpret availability certificates.
17.3.2.2 Consistency and snapshot isolation semantics
Snapshots provide a consistency boundary.
Rule 17.36 (Snapshot isolation). A SnapshotID defines a closed set of AtomCommits and EdgeIDs; any computation claiming reproducibility must reference a SnapshotID. “Latest” is not a reproducible reference.
Rule 17.37 (Registry view coherence). If multiple registries exist (distributed), published snapshots are the only authoritative states. Divergent unpublished states are treated as AMBIG and cannot be sealed without reconciliation.
17.3.2.3 Trust boundaries: signatures, access control, and provenance
Optional signing provides provenance.
Definition 17.38 (Signature record). If enabled, a manifest may include:[\mathrm{Sig}:=(\mathrm{KeyID},\ \mathrm{SigAlgID},\ \mathrm{SignatureBytes})]committing to SnapshotID/ModuleID. Verification policies are corridor-pinned for any corridor that treats signature as required evidence.
Access control is orthogonal to content integrity; it governs who may publish snapshots or read private artifacts. Access control decisions are not part of hash commitments, but publication records are.
17.3.2.4 Uncertainty ledgers for storage outcomes
Any missing object or unverifiable external pin yields:
AMBIG with evidence plan if resolution is possible (e.g., re-fetch, request credentials),
FAIL if corridor requires strict closure and the object cannot be retrieved,with explicit storage-ledger entries recording:
which digest is missing,
which retrieval step failed,
which repair move is available.
17.3.3 Algorithms
17.3.3.1 Verified streaming Put/Get
Algorithm 17.39 (PutStream). Stream bytes, compute digest incrementally, then commit digest and bytes; return CASRef.Algorithm 17.40 (GetStreamVerify). Fetch bytes by digest, verify incrementally; on mismatch, quarantine and attempt repair via replicas.
17.3.3.2 Replication, scrubbing, and repair
Algorithm 17.41 (Scrub). Periodically (policy-driven) sample or scan stored digests; verify bytes; repair from replicas when mismatch occurs; emit scrub transcripts as audit artifacts.
Algorithm 17.42 (RepairFromReplica). Fetch same digest from multiple replicas; choose the first matching verified bytes; re-replicate.
17.3.3.3 Snapshot publish/fetch pipeline
Algorithm 17.43 (PublishSnapshot). Input: SnapshotManifestNF. Steps:
store manifest bytes in CAS,
publish SnapshotID into transparency log (optionally signed),
store index pointers.
Algorithm 17.44 (FetchSnapshotVerify). Input: SnapshotID. Steps:
fetch manifest bytes by SnapshotID digest,
verify digest,
optionally verify signature,
ensure merkle-closure by fetching required referenced CAS objects (or return AMBIG with missing list).
17.3.3.4 External pin resolution and caching
Algorithm 17.45 (ResolveExternalPin). Fetch external bytes using RetrievalPolicy, verify fingerprint, store in CAS, emit ResolveTranscript. Cache only by fingerprint; never cache by URL alone. TimestampPolicy governs whether the resolver may update cached pins.
17.3.4 Certificates
17.3.4.1 Availability and replication certs
Certify that published snapshots/modules are retrievable with stated redundancy parameters and that merkle-closure can be achieved under the specified store policy.
17.3.4.2 Tamper-evidence and provenance certs
Certify digest verification and (if enabled) signature verification for published manifests, including revocation handling and key rotation evidence.
17.3.4.3 External pin integrity certs
Certify that all EXTERNAL references used by a sealed module/snapshot have valid fingerprints and that retrieval transcripts reproduce identical bytes matching the fingerprint.
17.3.4.4 Audit completeness cert
Certify that:
all published snapshots/modules appear in the transparency log,
all scrubbing/repair events are recorded,
quarantine overlays are applied when integrity checks fail,
no unverifiable objects are silently accepted into OK closure.
17.4 Fractal — Module sealing, hierarchical storage, extraction indices, and delta evolution
17.4.1 Objects
17.4.1.1 Module manifest schema: exports, imports, closure rules, policy sets
A module is a sealed subgraph (\mathcal M=(V_M,E_M)) with explicit interface.
ModuleManifestNF.[\mathrm{Module} := (\mathrm{ModuleID},\ \mathrm{Exports},\ \mathrm{Imports},\ \mathrm{RootSet},\ \mathrm{ClosureRules},\ \mathrm{PolicySet},\ \mathrm{SeedCommit},\ \mathrm{IndexCommits},\ \mathrm{QuarantineOverlay},\ \mathrm{ModuleVer})]
Exports: named GlobalAddrNFs that are intended as stable interface.
Imports: required external dependencies (GlobalAddrNFs outside module or ExternalPins).
ClosureRules: which edge kinds are included in closure (REF-required, plus required CERT/REPLAY/PROOF/IMPL by corridor).
PolicySet: corridor policies under which the module is valid.
SeedCommit: commitment to a seed that regenerates the module.
IndexCommits: commitments to extraction indices.
17.4.1.2 Seed objects and the compression contract
A seed stores generators and commitments, not bulk expansions.
SeedNF.[\mathrm{Seed} := (\mathrm{SeedID},\ \mathrm{RootSet},\ \mathrm{ExpansionRecipe},\ \mathrm{ClosureRules},\ \mathrm{WitnessReq},\ \mathrm{ReplayReq},\ \mathrm{CanonOrder},\ \mathrm{SeedVer})]The seed satisfies:[\mathrm{Compress}(\mathrm{Expand}(\mathrm{Seed})) = \mathrm{Seed}]under pinned policy. Seeds are the canonical “store in, not out” objects for modules and for large proof-carrying subgraphs.
17.4.1.3 Summary nodes and expansion edges
A summary node is a coarse representative of a module’s interface, with expansion edges:
GEN edges: generate detailed nodes from summary under pinned recipe,
INST edges: instantiate templates,
REF edges: connect summary to exports and imports,
PROOF/IMPL edges: bind interface claims to proofs/implementations stored in the module.
Summary nodes carry invariant signatures and budget signatures that permit fast routing and pruning before expansion.
17.4.1.4 Delta patches, incremental rebuild records, and preserved IDs
Kernel evolution is append-only with explicit deltas.
DeltaNF.[\Delta := (\DeltaID,\ \mathrm{BaseSnapshotID},\ \mathrm{NewSnapshotID},\ \mathrm{AddedAtoms},\ \mathrm{RemovedAtoms},\ \mathrm{AddedEdges},\ \mathrm{RemovedEdges},\ \mathrm{MigrateEdges},\ \mathrm{Conflicts},\ \mathrm{ReplayChanges},\ \mathrm{DeltaVer})]Preservation rule:
if an atom/edge content is unchanged, its AtomCommit/EdgeID must remain unchanged,
changes create new commits and are linked by MIGRATE edges or conflict packets.
17.4.2 Calculus
17.4.2.1 Strong vs weak module closure and corridor-dependent sealing
Rule 17.46 (Strong closure). For OK sealing under a strict corridor, module closure requires:
all INTRA/INTER refs resolve uniquely within module or via imports,
all required certificates and replays exist and verify,
no quarantined artifacts are used as prerequisites.
Rule 17.47 (Weak closure). For NEAR/AMBIG modules, closure may contain open obligations explicitly enumerated and bounded by corridor, with evidence plans attached. Such modules may not serve as proof-carrying dependencies for OK claims unless the corridor explicitly permits conditional dependency.
17.4.2.2 Hierarchical composition and idempotent expansion
Modules compose: a higher module may import other modules by their ModuleIDs/SnapshotIDs. Composition is valid only if:
imports are pinned (no “latest”),
policy sets are compatible,
combined closure does not violate quarantine overlays.
Idempotence requirements extend to module towers:[\mathrm{Expand}(\mathrm{Seed}_A)\cup \mathrm{Expand}(\mathrm{Seed}_B)]must be representable as a merged seed under pinned merge policies or else must remain as separate modules with explicit imports.
17.4.2.3 Budget tightening under expansion and route stability
Expansion increases detail and can tighten corridor requirements. A module may be NEAR at summary resolution and require additional certificates at expanded resolution. Promotion rules:
expansion cannot upgrade truth values without satisfying tightened budgets,
any derived OK claim must cite the expanded module’s witnesses and replays.
17.4.2.4 Explosion prevention: bounded expansion and proof depth controls
Because transitive closure can explode, module sealing requires explicit budgets:
max dependency depth,
max edge count,
max proof depth,
bounded loop enumeration for holonomy/twist audits.
If budgets are exceeded, the correct outcome is AMBIG with a finite plan (split the module, introduce summaries, refine closure rules), not partial OK.
17.4.3 Algorithms
17.4.3.1 SealModule: closure computation, manifest construction, ModuleID
Algorithm 17.48 (SealModule). Input: RootSet, Exports, corridor set, closure rules. Output: ModuleManifestNF and ModuleID.

Algorithm 17.50 (IncrementalRebuild). Input: base snapshot and change set. Output: new snapshot + DeltaNF.
Steps:
Rebuild only impacted atoms/edges; preserve commits for unchanged objects.
Emit MIGRATE edges for structural moves; emit CONFLICT packets for contradictions.
Run regression replays for impacted artifacts; update ReplayPtrs if kernel changes.
Emit SnapshotID and DeltaID.
17.4.3.4 Extraction index generation: quick-locate, cross-index, route indices
Algorithm 17.51 (BuildExtractionIndices). Generate:
Role indices (DEF/THM/ALG/CERT),
Lens/facet indices (Square/Flower/Cloud/Fractal × Objects/Calculus/Algorithms/Certificates),
Closure indices (export → closure set),
Route indices (canonical transport routes, cached RouteIDs),
Witness indices (edge → witness/replay manifests),all canonicalized and content-addressed.

module closure correctness under closure rules,
import pin correctness,
absence (or controlled presence) of obligations according to corridor,

CHAPTER 17 — KERNEL IMPLEMENTATION: DATA MODELS, IDS, SERIALIZATION (Addr ⟨0100⟩₄)
Chapter 18 — Deterministic Replay Harness & Certification Automation (Addr ⟨0101⟩₄)
18.1 Square — Replay scripts, transcript commitments, and deterministic execution semantics
18.1.1 Objects
18.1.1.1 KernelID, ExecutionEnvNF, and determinism envelope
A deterministic replay is an execution of a pinned computation that is reproducible at the transcript-commitment layer. Determinism is achieved by an explicit determinism envelope that constrains inputs, execution environment, and side effects.
Definition 18.1 (KernelID). A KernelID is a content-addressed identifier whose normal form binds the execution semantics:[\mathrm{KernelID}:=\mathrm{H}\big(\mathrm{CanonBytes}(\mathrm{KernelNF})\big),]where KernelNF includes, at minimum:
Runtime identity: language/runtime versions (e.g., Python/Node), proof-checker versions, compiler versions (if any).
Library set: pinned package names and versions; pinned build hashes for native dependencies.
Numeric environment: floating-point model (IEEE mode), rounding mode, denormal handling, BLAS/LAPACK identities, parallelism flags (including explicit disabling if required).
System envelope: OS family and version, CPU/GPU capability flags if relevant, and a virtualization/container signature when used.
Side-effect policy: network disabled/enabled, filesystem sandbox scope, time source policy, nondeterminism controls.
Canonical NF config: NFConfigID binding canonicalization rules for all serialized kernel objects.
Definition 18.2 (ExecutionEnvNF). ExecutionEnvNF is the manifest committed by every replay:[\mathrm{ExecutionEnvNF}:=(\mathrm{KernelID},\ \mathrm{NFConfigID},\ \mathrm{SysCapsNF},\ \mathrm{SideEffectNF},\ \mathrm{RandPolicyNF},\ \mathrm{LimitsNF}).]LimitsNF includes wall-clock and step budgets, memory limits, and loop enumeration limits; SideEffectNF specifies permitted IO channels.
Invariant 18.3 (Determinism envelope completeness). A replay is admissible for OK/NEAR corridors only if every execution-relevant choice (runtime, libraries, numeric modes, side effects, randomness) is explicitly bound by ExecutionEnvNF and committed in the transcript.
18.1.1.2 ReplayScriptNF: typed task graph, opcode steps, and schedule normal form
A replay is driven by a deterministic script. Scripts are typed and normalized.
Definition 18.4 (ReplayScriptNF). A ReplayScript is a DAG of tasks plus a total execution schedule consistent with the DAG:[\mathrm{ReplayScriptNF}:=(\mathrm{ScriptID},\ \mathrm{Goal},\ \mathrm{Tasks},\ \mathrm{Edges},\ \mathrm{ScheduleNF},\ \mathrm{IOPolicyNF},\ \mathrm{BudgetNF},\ \mathrm{ScriptVer}),]with:
Tasks: a finite list ({t_i}_{i=1}^m) of typed tasks,
Edges: dependency edges (t_i\prec t_j) forming an acyclic graph,
ScheduleNF: a deterministic total order extension of (\prec) produced by a pinned scheduler.
Definition 18.5 (Task types). TaskType is a closed enum. Representative task types:
LOAD: fetch CASRefs, verify digests, decode NF objects,
NORM: compute NF and CanonBytes,
HASH: compute commitments,
BUILD: construct AtomNF/LinkEdgeNF/ManifestNF,
CHECK: run validators, compute defect bounds, run invariant gates,
RUN: execute an algorithm step with pinned inputs,
PROVE: invoke proof checker on pinned proof artifacts,
TEST: run conformance tests on pinned data,
SEAL: emit LinkEdges/Module manifests/Snapshots.
Definition 18.6 (ScheduleNF). ScheduleNF is a deterministic list of task identifiers ((i_1,\dots,i_m)) such that (t_{i_a}\prec t_{i_b}\Rightarrow a<b). If multiple topological orders exist, tie-break is pinned by lexicographic task keys (TaskKeyNF), never by runtime iteration order.
18.1.1.3 TranscriptNF: step records, Merkle commitments, and replay pointers
A transcript is the committed execution record; it is the object that makes replay verifiable.
Definition 18.7 (TranscriptNF). A transcript is:[\mathrm{TranscriptNF}:=(\mathrm{TrID},\ \mathrm{ScriptID},\ \mathrm{ExecutionEnvNF},\ \mathrm{StepList},\ \mathrm{TrSummaryNF},\ \mathrm{TrVer}),]where StepList is an ordered list of step records (s_k).
Definition 18.8 (Step record). Each step record is:[s_k := (\mathrm{StepNo},\ \mathrm{TaskID},\ \mathrm{InputsCommit},\ \mathrm{OutputsCommit},\ \mathrm{EnvCommit},\ \mathrm{RandCommit},\ \mathrm{ExitNF},\ \mathrm{MetricsNF}),]with:
InputsCommit: hash of canonicalized inputs to the task (CASRefs + NF digests),
OutputsCommit: hash of canonicalized outputs (CASRefs created, result NFs),
EnvCommit: hash of ExecutionEnvNF (or pointer to it),
RandCommit: commitment to randomness usage (empty if RandPolicy forbids randomness),
ExitNF: status and localized error codes,
MetricsNF: corridor-permitted metrics (step counts, budget consumption, bounded timing intervals if timing is part of policy).
Definition 18.9 (Transcript hash). The transcript commitment is:[\mathrm{TrHash}:=\mathrm{H}\big(\mathrm{CanonBytes}(\mathrm{TranscriptNF})\big).]TranscriptNF is merkle-closed when its StepList includes all created CASRefs and all referenced CASRefs exist, and when TrSummaryNF includes a complete inventory digest of those objects.
18.1.1.4 ReplayResultNF: outputs, attestations, and failure localization
A replay outputs both computed artifacts and a classification.
Definition 18.10 (ReplayResultNF). ReplayResultNF is:[\mathrm{ReplayResultNF}:=(\mathrm{Outcome},\ \mathrm{OutputsNF},\ \mathrm{ArtifactsNF},\ \mathrm{ObligationsNF},\ \mathrm{QuarantineNF},\ \mathrm{ReplayPtrNF}),]where:
Outcome ∈ {PASS, FAIL, AMBIG},
OutputsNF is a canonical manifest of output commitments (AtomCommits, EdgeIDs, SnapshotIDs, ModuleIDs),
ArtifactsNF is a list of generated witness artifacts (defect ledgers, diagrams, proof checker outputs),
ObligationsNF records any generated obligations (Chapter 4),
QuarantineNF records any overlays created (Chapter 5.4),
ReplayPtrNF is the replay pointer record binding ScriptID, KernelID, inputs, commitments, outputs, and exit status.
Invariant 18.11 (Failure localization). FAIL must include a minimal localization: a deterministic identification of the earliest failing step and the minimal set of prerequisite commitments needed to reproduce the failure.
18.1.2 Calculus
18.1.2.1 Determinism invariants: purity, pinned inputs, and side-effect isolation
Rule 18.12 (Pinned-input determinism). All task inputs must be expressed exclusively as:
CASRefs (content-addressed bytes) and their digests,
GlobalAddrNFs resolved under a pinned SnapshotID or ModuleID,
explicit scalar parameters committed in InputsNF,
ExternalPins resolved into CASRefs via a pinned resolver transcript.No task may depend on ambient system state not committed by ExecutionEnvNF.
Rule 18.13 (Side-effect isolation). Allowed side effects are restricted to:
writing new CAS objects keyed by digest,
writing local ephemeral logs that do not affect commitments,
publishing to transparency logs only as a final SEAL stage with committed manifests.Network and time sources are forbidden unless explicitly permitted, in which case they must be mediated by ExternalPin resolution with fingerprint verification and transcript commitments.
18.1.2.2 Schedule determinism: topological order, stable tie-breaks, and bounded parallelism
Rule 18.14 (Deterministic scheduler). Given Tasks and dependency edges, ScheduleNF is uniquely determined by:
selecting all currently-ready tasks,
ordering them by TaskKeyNF,
executing in that order.If parallelism is permitted, it must be expressed as deterministic batching with pinned batch boundaries, and outputs must remain schedule-equivalent at the transcript-commitment level.
18.1.2.3 IO virtualization: external pins, artifact fetching, and transcript scoping
Rule 18.15 (External IO discipline). Any external content used in replay must be introduced only by an ExternalPin resolver task that:
fetches bytes via RetrievalPolicy,
verifies Fingerprint,
stores verified bytes into CAS,
emits a resolve transcript committed into the overall transcript.Any failure yields AMBIG (if retriable) or FAIL (if corridor requires strict closure), with obligation tickets to supply missing credentials or to pin missing fingerprints.
18.1.2.4 Replay equivalence and canonicalization: same NF implies same commitments
Definition 18.16 (Replay equivalence). Two replays are equivalent under a corridor if their TranscriptNF hashes match and their OutputsNF match, under the same ExecutionEnvNF. Equivalence may also be asserted when TranscriptNF differs only in corridor-permitted non-semantic metrics (e.g., bounded timing intervals), in which case equivalence is stated via a pinned equivalence predicate and must be certified.
Rule 18.17 (NF-commitment consistency). Because all commitments are computed over CanonBytes(NF(x)), any two executions that produce the same NF outputs must produce identical commitments. Therefore, any divergence in commitments implies either (i) semantic divergence, (ii) non-deterministic environment, or (iii) NF violation.
18.1.3 Algorithms
18.1.3.1 ReplayExecute: interpreter loop for ReplayScriptNF
Algorithm 18.18 (ReplayExecute). Inputs: ReplayScriptNF, initial InputsNF, ExecutionEnvNF. Outputs: TranscriptNF and ReplayResultNF.
Validate ExecutionEnvNF compatibility with Script requirements.
Validate all input CASRefs by digest.
Construct a deterministic scheduler from ScheduleNF.
For each Task in ScheduleNF:
decode and NF-normalize inputs,
execute Task in sandbox,
commit outputs to CAS,
append step record with InputsCommit and OutputsCommit,
enforce budget limits; on violation, stop with FAIL/AMBIG according to corridor.
After final task:
assemble OutputsNF and witness manifests,
compute TrHash and ReplayPtrNF,
return ReplayResultNF.
18.1.3.2 TranscriptVerify: recompute commitments and detect tamper or drift
Algorithm 18.19 (TranscriptVerify). Inputs: TranscriptNF, CAS store, corridor policy. Output: PASS/FAIL.
Checks:
Verify TranscriptNF hash matches TrHash.
For each step record:
fetch referenced input CASRefs and verify digests,
recompute InputsCommit and compare,
fetch referenced output CASRefs and verify digests,
recompute OutputsCommit and compare,
verify EnvCommit matches ExecutionEnvNF,
verify RandCommit matches declared randomness policy.
Verify TrSummaryNF inventory is complete (merkle-closure).
Emit FAIL minimal witness on first mismatch.
18.1.3.3 BuildReplayFromClaim: compile claim verification into a replay script
Algorithm 18.20 (CompileReplayScriptFromClaim). Inputs: claim atom address, corridor (C), snapshot (S). Output: ReplayScriptNF.
Steps:
Compute dependency closure of claim under corridor: required DEF/THM/ALG/CERT/REPLAY.
Build tasks:
LOAD: fetch atoms and edges from snapshot/module,
NORM: NF canonicalization of statements and edges,
CHECK: validators, invariant gates, defect computations,
PROVE/TEST: proof checker and conformance tests as required,
SEAL: if producing new edges/certs.
Compute deterministic ScheduleNF.
Bind all required KernelIDs and NFConfigID.
Output ReplayScriptNF with ScriptID.
18.1.3.4 Incremental replay and caching: subgraph reuse with commitment safety
Algorithm 18.21 (IncrementalReplay). Inputs: new change set, prior TranscriptNF, caching policy. Output: updated ReplayResultNF.
Rules:
reuse prior results only when inputs and env commitments match exactly,
cache keys include CorridorID, KernelID, NFConfigID, and relevant AtomCommits/EdgeIDs,
any cache hit is verified by digest before reuse,
cached outputs never bypass required checks; they only skip recomputation when commitments already guarantee equivalence.
18.1.4 Certificates
18.1.4.1 Replay determinism cert
Certifies that a given ReplayScriptNF is deterministic under the declared ExecutionEnvNF:
schedule determinism holds,
side-effect envelope is closed,
randomness is either forbidden or fully pinned,
repeated ReplayExecute yields identical TranscriptNF commitments.
18.1.4.2 Transcript completeness and merkle-closure cert
Certifies that:
TranscriptNF commits to all relevant inputs and outputs,
all referenced CASRefs exist and verify by digest,
TrSummaryNF inventory equals MerkleClose(Transcript),
no hidden dependencies exist outside the committed inputs.
18.1.4.3 Output commitment and artifact sufficiency cert
Certifies that OutputsNF and ArtifactsNF are sufficient for the target corridor claim:
all required witnesses (proof artifacts, test outputs, defect ledgers) are present,
sufficiency predicates per LinkEdge Kind are satisfied,
any missing items are recorded as obligations rather than ignored.
18.1.4.4 Recompute stability cert (commitment invariance under refactors)
Certifies that rebuilding AtomCommits, EdgeIDs, SnapshotIDs from NF inputs yields identical commitments under the pinned KernelID/NFConfigID, ensuring that refactors to builders do not change identity unless schema migration is explicitly performed.
18.2 Flower — Replay equivalence as a groupoid: commuting diagrams, gauge coherence, and holonomy
18.2.1 Objects
18.2.1.1 Replay morphisms and the ReplayGroupoid
Replays are compared as morphisms between committed states.
Definition 18.22 (Replay morphism). A replay morphism is:[\rho := (\mathrm{InputsCommit},\ \mathrm{OutputsCommit},\ \mathrm{ExecutionEnvNF},\ \mathrm{TranscriptNF}),]viewed as an arrow (\rho:\mathrm{Inputs}\to\mathrm{Outputs}).
Definition 18.23 (ReplayGroupoid). Objects are committed input states; morphisms are replay morphisms; composition is transcript concatenation when outputs of one replay match inputs of the next. Identity morphisms correspond to “no-op” scripts whose outputs equal inputs. Inverses exist only for replays that are certified invertible (rare; typically only for purely symbolic transformations with reversible maps).
18.2.1.2 Commuting-diagram witnesses for refactor invariance
When two different scripts claim to certify the same semantic relation, equivalence is asserted by commuting diagrams over their outputs and proofs.
Definition 18.24 (Replay commuting square). A commuting square is:[\begin{array}{ccc}I & \xrightarrow{\rho_1} & O_1\\downarrow{\rho_2} & & \downarrow{\rho_4}\O_2 & \xrightarrow{\rho_3} & O\end{array}]with a defect metric (\Delta) on outputs and a requirement (\Delta=0) (strict) or (\Delta\le \varepsilon) (NEAR). Witness objects include the two scripts, their transcripts, and the comparison computation (itself replayed).
18.2.1.3 Gauge objects for numeric and symbolic representations
Gauge conventions (phase, basis ordering, normalization) affect representations but may be semantically irrelevant when pinned.
Definition 18.25 (Replay gauge). A gauge is a deterministic normalization map (G) applied to intermediate artifacts (e.g., eigenbasis phase normalization, ordering canonicalization, alpha-normalization). Gauge objects are required when:
different correct executions produce representationally different but semantically equivalent artifacts,
and the corridor permits quotienting those differences.
Gauge operations must be explicit tasks in scripts; they may not be implicit runtime behavior.
18.2.1.4 Holonomy logs: order sensitivity as a measurable defect
Noncommuting validation passes can produce order-sensitive results; this is holonomy at the replay level.
Definition 18.26 (Replay holonomy defect). For two validation pipelines (A\circ B) and (B\circ A) applied to the same input, define:[\Delta_{\mathrm{hol}} := d\big((A\circ B)(x),\ (B\circ A)(x)\big)]on the relevant output space. Holonomy logs record these defects and trigger quarantine when they exceed corridor thresholds.
18.2.2 Calculus
18.2.2.1 Commutation obligations for certification passes
Rule 18.27 (No implicit commutation). Any reordering of certification passes is admissible only if:
the passes are proven to commute exactly on the declared domain, or
a commuting diagram witness bounds the defect within corridor tolerance.Otherwise, the router must treat reorderings as distinct routes and avoid assuming equivalence.
18.2.2.2 Kernel upgrade morphisms and harness migrations
When KernelID changes, equivalence of results requires explicit migration semantics.
Rule 18.28 (Harness migration). A change in KernelNF that could affect CanonBytes, hashing, numeric results, or proof checking must be treated as a new corridor-environment. Bridging statements require:
a harness migration cert asserting that commitments remain stable for the relevant object classes, or
MIGRATE edges for schema-level changes, or
downgrade to NEAR with bounded drift ledger when only approximate equivalence can be certified.
18.2.2.3 Gauge coherence constraints for replay outputs
Rule 18.29 (Gauge coherence). If a corridor permits gauge quotienting, scripts must:
apply gauge fixes deterministically at pinned points in the schedule,
record gauge parameters and normalization artifacts in the transcript,
ensure that gauge choice does not alter invariant suites used by the claim.Gauge inconsistency across scripts is treated as holonomy and triggers AMBIG/FAIL depending on corridor.
18.2.2.4 Conformance as invariants across runners
Conformance suites define invariants that must hold across environments and refactors:
NF idempotence,
hash recomputation consistency,
edge and atom validation equivalence,
replay transcript equivalence.These invariants are Flower-level: they certify that implementation variations preserve the same semantics under declared corridors.
18.2.3 Algorithms
18.2.3.1 DiagramCheck: certify equivalence of two replay scripts
Algorithm 18.30 (DiagramCheckReplayEquivalence). Inputs: ScriptA, ScriptB, common InputsNF, corridor. Outputs: diagram witness or conflict.
Steps:
Execute both scripts under pinned ExecutionEnvNF; obtain TranscriptA and TranscriptB.
Apply pinned gauge normalization to comparable outputs (if allowed).
Compute output defect (\Delta) under pinned metric.
Emit:
equivalence witness if (\Delta\le\varepsilon),
conflict packet if a lower bound (\Delta\ge\eta) is certified,
evidence plan if missing bounds prevent classification.
18.2.3.2 CrossRunnerNormalization: multi-platform conformance execution
Algorithm 18.31 (CrossRunnerNormalization). Inputs: a suite, a runner matrix of KernelIDs. Output: conformance results and holonomy logs.
For each KernelID:
run canonical encode/decode/NF tests,
run replay determinism tests for representative scripts,
compare TranscriptNF hashes and OutputsNF hashes across runners,
record any discrepancies as holonomy defects and quarantine affected corridors.
18.2.3.3 Witness extraction automation: produce minimal witness sets from transcripts
Algorithm 18.32 (AutoWitnessExtract). Input: TranscriptNF, corridor sufficiency predicates. Output: WitnessPtr manifest and MinimalWitnessSet.
Steps:
enumerate required witness roles for the claim type,
select minimal subset of produced artifacts sufficient for closure (deterministic pruning with replay verification),
emit WitnessPtr and MWS artifact with commitments and role labels.
18.2.3.4 Script canonicalization: rewrite engine with certified commutations
Algorithm 18.33 (CanonicalizeReplayScript). Input: ReplayScriptNF, corridor. Output: canonical script.
Rewrites permitted only with witnesses:
eliminate redundant NF tasks when already implied by upstream tasks and confirmed by transcript equivalence,
factor transport chains into canonical adjacent swaps (when relevant),
reorder commuting validators only when commuting proof exists.Emit updated ScriptID; ensure semantic equivalence certified by diagram witness.
18.2.4 Certificates
18.2.4.1 Replay equivalence cert
Certifies that two scripts are semantically equivalent under the corridor:
commuting diagram witness,
bounded defect or exact equality,
identical invariant suite outcomes,
identical or certified-equivalent outputs after gauge normalization.
18.2.4.2 Holonomy boundedness cert for certification pipelines
Certifies that order sensitivity is bounded within corridor thresholds for pinned pipeline permutations; otherwise produces obstruction/quarantine records.
18.2.4.3 Harness migration cert
Certifies that upgrading KernelNF (or proof checker versions) preserves commitments for declared object classes and corridor policies, or enumerates required MIGRATE steps and re-sealing requirements.
18.2.4.4 Gauge coherence cert
Certifies that gauge normalization is deterministic, stable, and does not alter corridor-relevant invariants; includes holonomy checks on pinned loop families.
18.3 Cloud — Stochastic replay, statistical certification, and flake control
18.3.1 Objects
18.3.1.1 RandPolicyNF: pinned randomness and stream schedule
Definition 18.34 (RandPolicyNF). RandPolicyNF is:[\mathrm{RandPolicyNF}:=(\mathrm{Allowed},\ \mathrm{PRNGID},\ \mathrm{SeedCommit},\ \mathrm{StreamNF},\ \mathrm{UsageNF})]with deterministic stream partitioning:
each task that consumes randomness receives a deterministic stream label,
each draw is indexed by (task label, draw index),
transcript records RandCommit sufficient to verify exact draw schedule.
18.3.1.2 StatisticalTestSpecNF: null/alt, metrics, and confidence semantics
Definition 18.35 (StatisticalTestSpecNF). A test spec is:[\mathrm{TestSpec}:=(\mathrm{Metric},\ \mathrm{Null},\ \mathrm{Alt},\ \alpha,\ \mathrm{AssumptionsNF},\ \mathrm{MethodNF},\ \mathrm{StopRulesNF})]where:
Metric is a pinned statistic,
(\alpha) is failure probability,
AssumptionsNF includes tail regime and dependence assumptions,
MethodNF pins estimator and test procedure,
StopRulesNF defines sample escalation and abstention conditions.
18.3.1.3 Stochastic transcript extensions: confidence envelopes and estimator ledgers
Stochastic replays extend TranscriptNF with:
per-test confidence bounds,
effective sample size diagnostics,
variance/bias estimates,
dependence/mixing evidence when samples are correlated.
All such additions must be committed in step records and must be composed under corridor rules (Chapter 4).
18.3.1.4 Flake objects and quarantine triggers
Definition 18.36 (Flake record). A flake record is:[\mathrm{Flake}:=(\mathrm{ScriptID},\ \mathrm{KernelID},\ \mathrm{RandPolicyNF},\ \mathrm{OutcomeDist},\ \mathrm{RootCauseHypotheses},\ \mathrm{RepairPlan})]where OutcomeDist summarizes PASS/FAIL rates under repeated runs and RootCauseHypotheses classify:
stochastic variance (insufficient samples),
environment nondeterminism (uncontrolled parallelism),
numeric instability (ill-conditioned computations),
genuine semantic ambiguity (identifiability issues).Flake triggers enforce quarantine for corridors that require deterministic OK sealing.
18.3.2 Calculus
18.3.2.1 Seeded determinism vs stochastic validity
Rule 18.37 (Replay determinism with randomness). If RandPolicyNF is allowed, determinism is achieved at the transcript level by committing to the seed and stream schedule; the realized random draws are reproducible. Statistical validity is separate and must be certified by TestSpec assumptions.
18.3.2.2 Confidence composition and conformance thresholds
Rule 18.38 (Conservative confidence composition). When multiple tests are used, overall failure probability is bounded by:[\alpha_{\mathrm{total}}\le \sum_i \alpha_i]unless an alternative correction is pinned. OK promotion under stochastic corridors requires (\alpha_{\mathrm{total}}) within corridor threshold and all assumptions certified.
18.3.2.3 Identifiability boundaries: when statistics cannot promote to OK
If a stochastic test cannot distinguish alternatives due to identifiability or information loss, the correct outcome is AMBIG with a structured evidence plan, never OK. Identifiability failures are treated as Air-type no-go for invertibility claims and must be recorded.
18.3.2.4 Flake calculus: distinguish variance from nondeterminism
Variance-induced inconsistency is repaired by increasing sample budgets; nondeterminism-induced inconsistency is repaired by tightening the determinism envelope (disable parallelism, pin numeric backends, or migrate to stable kernels). The calculus classifies flakes and prescribes repair moves; unclassified flakes block OK sealing.
18.3.3 Algorithms
18.3.3.1 MonteCarloReplay: pinned sampling execution with transcript commitments
Algorithm 18.39 (MonteCarloReplay). Inputs: ScriptNF with Test tasks, RandPolicyNF, sample budget schedule. Output: TranscriptNF with statistical artifacts.
Steps:
execute the script for (N) trials with pinned stream partitions,
compute test statistics and confidence bounds,
apply StopRulesNF (escalate (N) or abstain),
emit PASS/FAIL/AMBIG outcome with confidence envelope and evidence plan if needed.
18.3.3.2 BootstrapCertBuilder: empirical bounds with pinned resampling
Algorithm 18.40 (BootstrapCertBuilder). Inputs: statistic (T), resampling scheme, RandPolicyNF. Output: confidence interval and certificate.
Resampling must be deterministic under pinned stream schedule. Bootstrap is admissible only if corridor permits it and assumptions are declared; otherwise it yields NEAR/AMBIG.
18.3.3.3 FlakeReducer: variance reduction and determinism tightening
Algorithm 18.41 (FlakeReducer). Inputs: flake record, corridor policy. Output: repaired script or quarantine escalation.
Actions:
variance reduction: increase (N), use robust estimators, tighten confidence corrections,
determinism tightening: pin threads, pin BLAS, enforce fixed rounding, disable nondeterministic kernels,
numeric stabilization: add conditioning checks and degrade to NEAR if only bounded stability is available.If flake persists, produce FAIL minimal witness or AMBIG with explicit abstention.
18.3.3.4 Evidence plan synthesis for inconclusive statistical tests
Algorithm 18.42 (SynthesizeStatEvidencePlan). Generates a finite plan to achieve a target confidence:
increase sample size,
change estimator/test to one compatible with tail regime,
obtain mixing certificates for dependence,
add observables to resolve identifiability.Plan terminates under budget or yields formal abstention.
18.3.4 Certificates
18.3.4.1 Randomness pinning cert
Certifies that:
PRNG algorithm and seed are committed,
stream schedule is deterministic,
transcript captures all randomness usage,
reruns reproduce identical samples and identical outputs.
18.3.4.2 Statistical confidence cert
Certifies:
test specification and assumptions,
confidence interval correctness under pinned assumptions,
conservative composition across multiple tests,
mapping to corridor truth thresholds.
18.3.4.3 Flake-free cert and quarantine compliance
Certifies that:
repeated runs produce stable outcomes under the determinism envelope,
any residual stochasticity is accounted for in confidence semantics,
flaky pipelines are quarantined and cannot promote to OK.
18.3.4.4 NEAR→OK upgrade cert under stochastic corridors
Certifies promotion when:
structural defects are within OK thresholds,
statistical uncertainty is below corridor confidence requirements,
all assumptions required for bounds are certified,
replay determinism (including randomness) holds.
18.4 Fractal — Conformance suites, CI workflows, regression towers, and automated sealing
18.4.1 Objects
18.4.1.1 ConformanceSuiteNF: test families and coverage commitments
A conformance suite is the canonical automated certification program for kernel correctness.
Definition 18.43 (ConformanceSuiteNF). A suite is:[\mathrm{Suite}:=(\mathrm{SuiteID},\ \mathrm{SuiteVer},\ \mathrm{Targets},\ \mathrm{Tests},\ \mathrm{CoverageNF},\ \mathrm{BudgetNF},\ \mathrm{StopRulesNF})]Targets include schema versions, object classes, corridor classes, and kernel versions. CoverageNF pins which invariants are tested:
NF idempotence,
CanonBytes stability,
AtomCommit and EdgeID recomputation,
module expand/merge idempotence,
replay determinism,
route canonicalization determinism,
quarantine enforcement.
18.4.1.2 CIWorkflowNF: pipeline stages, gates, and artifact publication rules
Definition 18.44 (CIWorkflowNF). A workflow is:[\mathrm{CI}:=(\mathrm{CIID},\ \mathrm{Stages},\ \mathrm{GateRules},\ \mathrm{RunnerMatrix},\ \mathrm{ArtifactsPolicy},\ \mathrm{PromotionPolicy},\ \mathrm{CIver})]Stages are ordered: build → unit conformance → replay regression → cross-runner conformance → module sealing → snapshot sealing → publish. GateRules map stage results to corridor truth, controlling whether artifacts may be sealed or published.
18.4.1.3 RegressionSnapshotLadder: versionline tracking and delta verification
A regression ladder is a sequence of snapshots under a monotone versionline with deltas.
Definition 18.45 (Regression ladder). A ladder is:[(\mathrm{SnapshotID}_0 \preceq \mathrm{SnapshotID}_1 \preceq \cdots \preceq \mathrm{SnapshotID}_T)]with Delta records linking consecutive snapshots. Regression suites ensure:
preserved commitments for unchanged objects,
explicit MIGRATE edges for schema transitions,
replay stability for all pinned scripts.
18.4.1.4 Attestation bundles: release proofs and publishable seals
An attestation bundle is the sealed output of CI that justifies publishing a snapshot/module.
Definition 18.46 (AttestationBundleNF). Bundle includes:
SnapshotManifestNF and SnapshotID,
suite results and SuitePassCerts,
replay transcripts and ReplayDeterminismCerts for required scripts,
migration certs for any schema/kernel changes,
quarantine summary and confirmation of compliance.
18.4.2 Calculus
18.4.2.1 Stage gates: mapping CI outcomes to corridor truth
Rule 18.47 (CI gate discipline). A publishable artifact is OK only if:
all mandatory conformance tests pass,
all required replays pass under pinned KernelIDs,
no quarantined blockers exist for the published scope,
external pins are resolved or explicitly ticketed as permitted by corridor.If any stage is inconclusive, CI must output AMBIG with evidence plan (increase coverage, add runner, fix nondeterminism) rather than publishing.
18.4.2.2 Tightening schedules across releases: from NEAR to OK
Release workflows enforce tightening:
early stages allow NEAR (bounded defects) for internal artifacts,
final stage requires OK (full closure) for published snapshots,
any NEAR published artifact must be explicitly labeled as NEAR and accompanied by obligation plans; strict publish corridors may forbid NEAR publication entirely.
18.4.2.3 Incremental verification correctness: cache safety and delta soundness
Incremental CI is admissible only if caches are commitment-safe:
cache keys include KernelID, NFConfigID, CorridorID, and input commitments,
cache hits are verified by digest,
delta verification ensures preserved commitments for unchanged objects.Any cache uncertainty forces AMBIG and triggers full recomputation.
18.4.2.4 Explosion prevention: bounded suites and stratified testing
CI must be bounded:
suites must have explicit budgets,
coverage is stratified by module boundaries and snapshots,
deep closure checks are performed on exports and their transitive closures rather than on the entire graph when permitted,
any budget overflow yields AMBIG with evidence plan (split module, refine targets, adjust closure rules), never partial OK.
18.4.3 Algorithms
18.4.3.1 RunConformanceSuite: deterministic orchestration
Algorithm 18.48 (RunConformanceSuite). Inputs: SuiteNF, Runner (KernelID), Snapshot/Module targets. Output: Suite transcript and Suite results.
Steps:
compile suite tests into ReplayScripts,
execute with deterministic scheduler,
verify transcripts and outputs,
aggregate results under pinned coverage rules and stop rules,
emit PASS/FAIL/AMBIG with localized evidence.
18.4.3.2 RegressionMatrix: versions × runners × suites
Algorithm 18.49 (BuildRegressionMatrix). Inputs: snapshot ladder, runner matrix, suite set. Output: regression matrix results and migration obligations.
Steps:
for each snapshot and runner: run mandatory suite subset,
compare commitments across snapshots: preserved IDs for unchanged objects,
compare transcripts across runners: holonomy defects and platform drift,
emit MIGRATE requirements or quarantine overlays when drift is detected.
18.4.3.3 CIOrchestrator: stage-by-stage artifact production and sealing
Algorithm 18.50 (CIOrchestrate). Inputs: CIWorkflowNF, change set, base SnapshotID. Output: AttestationBundleNF or AMBIG/FAIL.
Stages:
build and compute candidate Atom/Edge changes,
run unit conformance (NF, serialization, validators),
run replay regression on impacted scripts,
run cross-runner checks when required,
seal module(s) and snapshot(s),
publish attestation bundle and transparency log entry.
Each stage emits transcripts and commitments; failures produce minimal witnesses and quarantine overlays.
18.4.3.4 SealReleaseSnapshot: final publish step with attestation
Algorithm 18.51 (SealReleaseSnapshot). Inputs: candidate SnapshotManifestNF, required suite certs, replay certs. Output: published SnapshotID and attestation.
Steps:
verify merkle-closure and external pin integrity,
verify suite pass and replay determinism certs,
verify no disallowed NEAR/AMBIG statuses remain in publish scope,
compute SnapshotID and store manifest in CAS,
publish to transparency log (optionally signed),
output AttestationBundleNF.
18.4.4 Certificates
18.4.4.1 Suite pass cert (coverage-complete conformance)
Certifies that a suite passed with:
pinned SuiteID and SuiteVer,
pinned KernelID and NFConfigID,
pinned target snapshot/module IDs,
coverage obligations satisfied (no skipped required tests),
transcript commitments verified and merkle-closed.
18.4.4.2 Regression stability cert
Certifies that:
unchanged objects preserve AtomCommit/EdgeID across versions,
MIGRATE edges correctly account for schema/kernel changes,
replay outputs for required scripts are stable across the regression ladder,
any drift is quarantined and does not contaminate publish artifacts.
18.4.4.3 CI attestation cert
Certifies that:
CIWorkflowNF gates were followed deterministically,
every published artifact is justified by transcripts and suite pass certs,
external pins are valid and verified,
quarantine overlays were respected.
18.4.4.4 Release OK cert (publishable snapshot/module correctness)
Certifies that the released SnapshotID/ModuleID satisfies:
strong closure predicates required by publish corridor,
deterministic replay commitments for all required certification scripts,
absence of unresolved strict obligations,
integrity and merkle-closure of all referenced CAS objects,thereby permitting downstream OK claims to cite the release as a stable proof-carrying substrate.
CHAPTER 18 — DETERMINISTIC REPLAY HARNESS & CERTIFICATION AUTOMATION (Addr ⟨0101⟩₄)
Chapter 19 — Rotation Toolkit: Basis/Resolution Dualities and Transforms (Addr ⟨0102⟩₄)
19.0 The “rotation thesis” and the four-corner atlas
Master object. Every “appearance” in this toolkit is a coordinate shadow of one invariant payload[\mathfrak C := (\mathcal H,;A,;\psi)](carrier (\mathcal H), generator/operator family (A), state (\psi)), plus a declared readout and a declared corridor (the subspace where conversions are stable/injective/commuting).
Two primitive rotations generate the whole chapter (everything else is composition):
Basis rotation (Wave ⇄ Particle): choose a basis that diagonalizes (A) (spectral/wave) vs a basis that localizes (\psi) (particle/local).
Resolution/substrate rotation (Continuous ⇄ Discrete): restrict/sample and reconstruct/lift via[S_h:\mathcal H\to \mathbb C^{N(h)},\qquad R_h:\mathbb C^{N(h)}\to\mathcal H,\qquad \Pi_h:=R_hS_h.]The projector (\Pi_h) is the “what this resolution can truthfully represent” gate.
Four-corner atlas (CP/CW/DP/DW). The product (basis × substrate) yields the minimal atlas:
[\begin{array}{c|cc}& \textbf{Particle (local basis)} & \textbf{Wave (spectral basis)} \\hline\textbf{Continuous} & \text{CP} & \text{CW} \\textbf{Discrete} & \text{DP} & \text{DW}\end{array}]
The 6 primitive “becoming edges”. Between 4 corners there are exactly 6 pairwise transitions, and this chapter treats each as an explicit forward/back algorithm (not a metaphor).We will use the canonical map names (all are typed; domains/codomains matter):
E1: CP ↔ CW : (B_C) (Fourier/eigen expansion on the continuum)
E2: DP ↔ DW : (B_D) (DFT/GFT/eigenmodes on the discrete substrate)
E3: CP ↔ DP : (S_h, R_h), with (\Pi_h=R_hS_h)
E4: CW ↔ DW : fold/unfold (F_h, U_h) (Nyquist/alias corridor required)
E5: CP ↔ DW : (DW=B_D(S_h(CP))), inverse by (R_h(B_D^{-1}(\cdot)))
E6: CW ↔ DP : (DP=S_h(B_C^{-1}(CW))), inverse by (B_C(R_h(\cdot))) with lift constraints
Commuting-diagram discipline (the test harness). Duality is never “assumed.” For any diagram intended to commute, define the path defect operator[\Delta := f - (h\circ g).]“Symmetry” is (\Delta=0) (exact) or (|\Delta|) provably small on the declared corridor.
We also track two higher-order failure signatures:
Anti-symmetry / defect taxonomy: kernel/quotient loss (Square), alias/leak (Flower), uncertainty inflation (Cloud), holonomy/curvature (Fractal).
Spin (holonomy): loop-twist from noncommutation, measured by a group-commutator around a square; leading term is commutator curvature.
The rest of Chapter 19 is the concrete toolkit that implements these rotations and the tests that certify (or falsify) equivalence.
19.1 Square — Projectors, intertwiners, and local algebra (the “operator wiring”)
19.1.1 Formal objects and axioms
(S1) Typed corner objects.
CP: (\psi) as a function/distribution on a continuum carrier.
DP: (\mathbf x\in\mathbb C^{N}) (samples/finite coefficients in a local basis).
CW: (\widehat\psi) as spectral coefficients (Fourier/eigenfunction coordinates).
DW: (\widehat{\mathbf x}\in\mathbb C^{N}) in a discrete spectral basis.
(S2) Projectors as first-class citizens.A projector (P) satisfies (P^2=P). The toolkit uses four “canonical” projectors repeatedly:
Representability projector (\Pi_h=R_hS_h) (what can be represented at resolution (h)).
Bandlimit projector (\mathcal P_B) (kills out-of-band content before sampling).
Low-band “same-physics” projector (P_{\le\Lambda}) (restrict comparisons to a spectral window where discretizations align).
Spin/commutator damping projector ( \mathcal P_{\text{spin},\varepsilon}) (projects to a subspace where key commutators are small).
(S3) Intertwiner residuals (the “physics consistency” probes).Given a continuum operator (A) and a discrete shadow (A_h), define the two canonical mismatch operators:[\Delta_A^{(S)} := A_h S_h - S_h A,\qquad \Delta_A^{(R)} := R_h A_h - A R_h.]These are the Square-side source code of “diagram doesn’t commute.”
19.1.2 Invariants and core theorems
(S4) The round-trip invariants.
Resolution round-trip residual: (r_h(\psi)=|\psi-\Pi_h\psi|). Small means (\psi) lives near the representability corridor.
Basis round-trip residual: (r_B(x)=|x-B^{-1}Bx|). Zero if (B) is an exact isomorphism (unitary/invertible as required).
(S5) Kernel/quotient principle.If a forward map (sampling/projection) has nontrivial kernel, distinct states share the same observed data. That loss is structural, not “noise,” and no amount of averaging can recover it (this is a Square diagnosis that later reappears as Cloud non-identifiability).
19.1.3 Constructions and algorithms
(S6) Projector calculus for compositions.For commuting projectors (P,Q): ((PQ)^2=PQ) and (\mathrm{Fix}(PQ)=\mathrm{Fix}(P)\cap\mathrm{Fix}(Q)).When they don’t commute, the chapter uses alternating projections (see §19.4) to approximate an intersection corridor.
(S7) Minimal-norm lifts (pseudo-inverse doctrine).When an inverse is ill-posed or non-unique (e.g., fold/unfold, undersampled reconstruction), define the lift as a constrained solution:[\text{choose } x^\star = \arg\min |x|\quad\text{s.t.}\quad Fx=y,;;x\in\text{Corridor}.]This is the “least hallucination” rule: pick a canonical representative of an equivalence class.
19.1.4 Canonical examples and verification tests
Square Test Battery (deterministic):
Idempotence test: (|P^2-P|) for each projector.
Round-trip test: (|\psi-\Pi_h\psi|), (|x-B^{-1}Bx|).
Intertwiner test: (|\Delta_A^{(S)}|) and (|\Delta_A^{(R)}|) on a declared test family (often low-band).
Conditioning test: (\kappa(B)), (\kappa(R_h)), effective rank of (S_h).
Diagram test (Square side): compute operator residuals like (|B_D S_h - F_h B_C|) on corridor samples (see §19.5).
19.2 Flower — Fourier, log/Mellin, Wick: spectral rotations as controlled gates
19.2.1 Formal objects and axioms
(F1) Fourier/eigen transforms as basis rotations.
Continuous: (B_C) is Fourier or eigenfunction expansion.
Discrete: (B_D) is DFT or graph Fourier (diagonalization by eigenvectors of a discrete Laplacian/adjacency).
This is the CP↔CW and DP↔DW backbone.
(F2) The log bridge (additive ↔ multiplicative).Use (x=e^t). With the Haar measure (dx/x), the map[(U_{\log}f)(t)=f(e^t)]is unitary (L^2(\mathbb R_+,dx/x)\to L^2(\mathbb R,dt)).This makes “scale” behave like “translation” on the log axis and is the formal entry point for Mellin-as-Fourier.
(F3) π-normalization lock (anti-drift).To prevent convention/window drift from masquerading as structure, the toolkit pins a single Fourier convention in which the Gaussian (e^{-\pi t^2}) is self-dual.This matters because the commuting-diagram tests are numerical: if your normalization drifts, your defects are meaningless.
(F4) Wick rotation (unitary ↔ diffusive).Given a self-adjoint (A), the unitary group (e^{itA}) (oscillatory) and the contractive semigroup (e^{-tA}) (diffusive) are related by analytic continuation (t\mapsto -it) when the functional calculus is valid (domain + spectral hypotheses). In this chapter, Wick is treated as a rotation in the complex-time plane that swaps “phase propagation” for “smoothing” while preserving spectral geometry (same eigenvectors, eigenvalues rotated through (i\mathbb R\to \mathbb R_-)).
19.2.2 Invariants and core theorems
(F5) Plancherel / Parseval invariants.On the locked convention, (|f|_2=|\mathcal F f|_2) (and analogues for discrete transforms). This is a non-negotiable test gate: any “Fourier rotation” that violates energy transport is not the same rotation.
(F6) Nyquist corridor as the decisive injectivity gate.The CW↔DW fold/unfold edge is injective only on a bandlimited corridor (“no replica overlap”). Leaving that corridor is not a small error—it is a quotient collapse (many-to-one).
(F7) Wick invariants.Wick changes time character (unitary ↔ contractive), but preserves:
eigenvectors (same spectral basis),
spectral ordering (up to sign/rotation),
diagonalizability structure (what was diagonal stays diagonal).
So Wick commutes with basis rotation (B) in the spectral lens (the whole point of using spectral coordinates).
19.2.3 Constructions and algorithms
(F8) Mellin via log-FFT (scale spectrum from FFT).Pipeline:
sample (f(x)) on a log grid (x_k=e^{t_k}),
weight by the correct measure policy (Haar discipline),
apply the π-window (stability),
FFT in (t), interpret frequencies as scale-frequencies.This is the log engine that makes “scale Fourier” operational, not poetic.
(F9) Wick as a compiled operator.Treat Wick as the map on propagators:[\text{Wick}(U(t)) := U(-it),]implemented by switching the time-stepper from phase-accurate (unitary) to stability-accurate (contractive) without changing the spectral basis.
(F10) Spectral projectors.Given eigenpairs ((\lambda_k,\phi_k)), define
Bandlimit projector: (P_{\le\Lambda} f = \sum_{\lambda_k\le\Lambda}\langle f,\phi_k\rangle \phi_k)
Functional calculus filters: (H(A) f = \sum_k H(\lambda_k)\langle f,\phi_k\rangle \phi_k)
These are the Flower-native projectors used to (i) enforce corridors and (ii) make commutation measurable.
19.2.4 Canonical examples and verification tests
Flower Test Battery (spectral):
Self-dual Gaussian test (π-lock compliance).
Energy transport test: (||f|_2^2-|\widehat f|_2^2|) below tolerance.
Nyquist test: detect replica overlap / alias signatures (CW↔DW corridor check).
Wick commutation test: confirm (B,e^{-tA}\approx e^{-t\Lambda}B) in spectral coordinates (diagonal propagation consistency).
19.3 Cloud — Uncertainty transport, identifiability, and statistical commutation tests
19.3.1 Formal objects and axioms
(C1) Pushforward view of rotations.If (\psi) (or data) is random, every map (T) induces a pushforward distribution (T_#\mu). A “commuting diagram” can be tested as distributional equality (or near-equality):[f_#\mu \approx (h\circ g)_#\mu.]
(C2) Uncertainty ledger for every edge.Attach a triple to each conversion:[(\text{bias},;\text{variance},;\text{entropy inflation}),]and require the chapter to separate:
structural loss (non-injectivity/aliasing/ill-conditioning), vs
stochastic noise (reducible by averaging).
This matches the anti-symmetry taxonomy.
19.3.2 Invariants and core theorems
(C3) “Averaging test” for structural vs noisy error.If the residual does not shrink with more samples/ensembles, it is structural (Square/Flower/Fractal defect). If it shrinks like (1/\sqrt{N}), it is Cloud-noise. This is the practical consequence of the defect taxonomy.
(C4) Divergence invariants as commutation metrics.Define a divergence (KL/JS/Wasserstein) on outputs from two paths. A commuting diagram in Cloud means this divergence is small on the corridor, with explicit confidence intervals.
19.3.3 Constructions and algorithms
(C5) Probabilistic diagram test.Given two paths (p_1, p_2) from the same source corner:
run both on an ensemble ({\psi^{(i)}}),
compute a chosen statistic family (r(\cdot)) (moments, energies, spectral band masses),
measure divergence between the empirical distributions of (r(p_1(\psi^{(i)}))) and (r(p_2(\psi^{(i)}))),
bootstrap to attach uncertainty bounds.
(C6) Minimal-norm lift with posterior interpretation.When CW↔DW or CP↔DP inversion is non-unique, interpret the feasible set as an equivalence class; pick the minimal-norm element as a “maximum ignorance” (least injected structure) representative.
19.3.4 Canonical examples and verification tests
Cloud Test Battery (statistical):
Loop divergence test: run a loop and check KL/JS residuals before/after (spin shows up as irreducible divergence).
Noise vs structural separation: increase ensemble size; see what shrinks.
Confidence-stamped commutation: report (\mathbb E[| \Delta \psi|]) with CI and the corridor assumptions.
19.4 Fractal — Multi-scale rotations, holonomy, and the snap-to-corridor engine
19.4.1 Formal objects and axioms
(R1) Zero points (fixed corridors).For a forward map (f:X\to Y) and a backward map (g:Y\to X), define the “zero corridor”[Z_X := \mathrm{Fix}(g\circ f)={x\in X:\ g(f(x))=x}.]These are the maximal subspaces where “becoming” is reversible.
(R2) Meta-zero (the intersection corridor).The chapter uses the intersection of key zero corridors (carrier legality, Nyquist, representability, spectral alignment, spin-kill) as the “zero point of everything.”
19.4.2 Invariants and core theorems
(R3) Spin (holonomy) as the invariant obstruction.Even if each step is “close,” noncommutation accumulates around loops. Spin is the loop commutator; its leading behavior is governed by commutators.This is the rigorous meaning of “path dependence” in the rotation atlas.
19.4.3 Constructions and algorithms
(R4) The Meta-Zero Snap Operator (corridor lock).Define a projector stack enforcing corridors (bandlimit, representability, low-band alignment, spin-kill) and iterate to a fixed point:[\psi_\star := \lim_{k\to\infty} \left(\mathcal P_{\text{spin},\varepsilon},P_{\le\Lambda},\Pi_h,\mathcal P_B\right)^k \psi.]This produces a canonical representative whose corner projections are mutually consistent up to tolerance, plus a defect ledger of what could not be repaired.
19.4.4 Canonical examples and verification tests
Fractal Test Battery (multiscale + loop):
Snap convergence curve: residual vs iteration count (detect empty/weak intersections).
Scale ladder commutation: refine (h) and verify that low-band corridor enlarges and residuals shrink.
Spin test: run a representative loop (e.g., split propagation vs fused propagation) and measure deviation from identity; compare forward vs reverse spin for orientation sanity.
19.5 The commuting-diagram suite (the “unit tests” for CP/CW/DP/DW)
Below are the three commuting squares that usually matter most in practice; each defines a defect operator (\Delta) you can compute.
Diagram A — “sample then diagonalize” vs “diagonalize then fold”
Goal: CP → DWTwo paths:
Path 1: (CP \xrightarrow{S_h} DP \xrightarrow{B_D} DW)
Path 2: (CP \xrightarrow{B_C} CW \xrightarrow{F_h} DW)
Defect operator:[\Delta_{A} := B_D S_h - F_h B_C.]Interpretation: do local sampling and discrete spectral analysis match the continuum spectral picture after folding? This is the backbone of “discrete ≈ continuous” spectral claims.
Diagram B — “reconstruct after inverse discrete spectrum” vs “inverse continuum spectrum then reconstruct”
Goal: DW → CPTwo paths:
Path 1: (DW \xrightarrow{B_D^{-1}} DP \xrightarrow{R_h} CP)
Path 2: (DW \xrightarrow{U_h} CW \xrightarrow{B_C^{-1}} CP)
Defect operator:[\Delta_{B} := R_h B_D^{-1} - B_C^{-1} U_h.]Interpretation: are your lift conventions (bandlimited vs minimal-norm) consistent with your reconstruction rule?
Diagram C — Wick commutation in spectral coordinates
Goal: “propagate then rotate” vs “rotate then propagate” in the wave cornerFor self-adjoint (A), compare:
(B_C,e^{-tA}) vs (e^{-t\Lambda},B_C) (diagonal propagation in eigenbasis)
Defect operator:[\Delta_{C}(t) := B_C e^{-tA} - e^{-t\Lambda} B_C.]Interpretation: this is where “Wick rotation as a safe move” becomes testable: you either preserve diagonal propagation, or you’re not actually in the spectral corridor.
Each diagram comes with:
a corridor declaration (bandlimit, low-band, representability, etc.),
a norm choice (what does “small” mean),
a certificate (residual + acceptance threshold),
a falsifier (e.g., deliberately violate Nyquist and watch (\Delta) explode).
19.6 Deliverable: the Rotation Toolkit interface (what Chapter 20 will consume)
Minimal API surface (conceptual):
basis.rotate(psi, corner, target_corner) : uses (B_C) or (B_D) with pinned normalization.
resolution.sample(psi, h) : (S_h)
resolution.reconstruct(x, h) : (R_h)
spectral.fold(cw, h) / spectral.unfold(dw, h, mode="bandlimited|min_norm") : (F_h, U_h)
projector.bandlimit(B) / projector.lowband(Lambda) / projector.representability(h) / projector.spin_kill(eps)
tests.diagram_A/B/C(...) : returns (|\Delta|), plus structured defect breakdown (kernel/alias/uncertainty/spin)
snap.meta_zero(psi, params) : runs the snap operator and returns (\psi_\star) + full ledger
That is the rotation toolkit as a machine: it doesn’t just move between CP/CW/DP/DW—it tells you exactly when it can, exactly why it can’t, and how much twist (spin) remains when you close a loop.
Chapter 20 — Domain Pack I: The Four Forces as Certified Rotation Classes (Addr ⟨0103⟩₄)
20.1 Square — Force-theory presentations, discrete shadows, and solver-ready normal forms
20.1.1 Objects
20.1.1.1 ForceTheory object schema and presentation layer
A force is represented as a structured theory object whose semantics are carried by presentations (Chapter 2) and whose legal equivalences are realized by certified rotations (Chapters 3–5, 19).
Definition 20.1 (ForceTheory). A force-theory object is a tuple[\mathfrak F := (\mathcal B,\ \mathcal E,\ \mathcal G,\ \mathcal A,\ \mathcal S,\ \mathcal I),]where:
(\mathcal B) is the base (smooth manifold with additional structure, or a discrete complex).
(\mathcal E) is the carrier bundle data (vector bundle, principal bundle, tetrad bundle, etc.).
(\mathcal G) is the structure group (internal gauge group, local frame group, diffeomorphism group, or product thereof).
(\mathcal A) is the action/principle-of-stationarity data (Lagrangian density, variational boundary terms, discretized action, gauge-fixing terms, ghost terms where applicable).
(\mathcal S) is the symmetry package (actions on fields, gauge redundancies, BRST data, diffeomorphism covariance, discrete subgroup constraints).
(\mathcal I) is the invariant suite required to interpret and certify rotations (Noether charges, Bianchi identities, topological charges, positivity/energy conditions, spectral windows, and any renormalization invariants).
Definition 20.2 (Force presentation). A force-theory induces a family of presentations ({\mathcal P_\alpha}) on a carrier (X) of admissible field configurations:[\mathcal P_\alpha = (X,\Phi_\alpha,\mathbb V_\alpha,\mathbb V_{0,\alpha},\mathrm{Dom}\alpha,\mathrm{Meta}\alpha),]where (\Phi_\alpha) encodes Euler–Lagrange equations, constraints, gauge-fixing conditions, boundary conditions, and auxiliary certification observables; (\mathrm{Dom}_\alpha) encodes domain/branch admissibility and gauge/diffeomorphism admissibility.
Definition 20.3 (Domain Pack). A domain pack for a force is the kernel-sealed module consisting of:
canonical presentations (RNF/PNF),
canonical rotation classes and admissibility guards,
canonical invariant suites and defect metrics,
solver pipelines and replay harnesses,
certificates mapping to corridor truth (OK/NEAR/AMBIG/FAIL).
20.1.1.2 Discrete carriers and field encodings for the four forces
Each force admits a Square-layer discretization used as the solver substrate and as a certification anchor.
Electromagnetism (EM).
Carrier: cochains on a cell complex (or finite elements) with (A\in C^1) and (F=dA\in C^2).
Constraints: discrete Maxwell equations and boundary conditions; gauge (A\mapsto A+d\lambda).
Observables: fluxes, energy, Poynting invariants, gauge-invariant line integrals.
Weak (EW sector).
Carrier: discrete gauge fields for (SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y) (or effective operators on a lattice/mesh) plus Higgs/scalar fields.
Constraints: gauge constraints, symmetry breaking constraints, effective low-energy constraints (Fermi limit) as presentations.
Observables: gauge-invariant amplitudes, conserved currents, effective couplings at a scale.
Strong (QCD / Yang–Mills).
Carrier: lattice gauge links (U_\ell\in SU(3)) on edges and plaquette holonomies encoding curvature.
Constraints: gauge invariance at vertices, Gauss law in Hamiltonian formulations, action-based constraints in Euclidean formulations.
Observables: Wilson loops, Polyakov loops, topological charge proxies, hadronic correlators.
Gravity (GR).
Carrier: metric variables (g) (or tetrads (e) and spin connections (\omega)) discretized by finite elements, Regge calculus, or spectral grids.
Constraints: Hamiltonian/momentum constraints (3+1), gauge conditions (lapse/shift), boundary conditions (well-posed variational boundary terms).
Observables: curvature invariants, conserved fluxes (when defined), waveform observables, constraint energies.
20.1.1.3 Invariant suites as discrete gates for admissibility and equivalence
Square invariants are the hard gates that block illegal moves and distinguish equivalence from coincidence.
Definition 20.4 (Square invariant suite for a force). A Square invariant suite is[\mathfrak I_{\square}(\mathfrak F):=(\mathrm{KernelInv},\mathrm{ConstraintInv},\mathrm{GaugeInv},\mathrm{BoundaryInv}),]with:
KernelInv: rank/nullity and discrete kernel structure (e.g., cohomology kernels for EM; Gauss-law kernel; constraint kernel for GR).
ConstraintInv: residuals of constraint presentations (Euler–Lagrange, constraint equations).
GaugeInv: gauge-invariant observable checks and gauge-fix validity checks.
BoundaryInv: boundary compatibility invariants (flux matching, boundary data admissibility).
Invariant suites are referenced by all certified rotations in the domain pack and are evaluated at each solver step for Snap stabilization (Chapter 16).
20.1.1.4 Defect energies and residual ledgers for discrete force objects
Square-layer correctness is expressed through explicit defect energies.
Definition 20.5 (Force defect energy). For a candidate discrete state (x\in X_h), define:[E_{\mathfrak F}(x) := \sum_{j=1}^m w_j,\mathrm{Res}{\mathcal P_j}(x)^2 ;+; \sum{k} \eta_k,\Delta_k(x)^2,]where:
(\mathcal P_j) are the required presentations (equations, constraints, gauge-fix, boundary),
(\Delta_k) are structural defects (commutator/diagram defects, lattice preservation defects, discretization defects),
weights (w_j,\eta_k) are corridor-pinned.
Definition 20.6 (Residual ledger). The residual ledger records each term of (E_{\mathfrak F}) as a typed entry, together with method (analytic/verified numeric/replay), region, assumptions, and commitments (Chapter 4).
20.1.2 Calculus
20.1.2.1 Discrete-to-continuum commutation and representability corridors
Square discretizations are legal only on corridors where representability and commutation defects are controlled.
Rule 20.7 (Representability corridor). A discretization is admissible on a declared corridor if there exist restriction/prolongation maps (S_h,R_h) such that:
(S_h) is well-defined on the admissible domain,
(\Pi_h=R_hS_h) is a projector-like map whose defect (| \Pi_h^2-\Pi_h|) is bounded,
key operators commute with sampling/reconstruction to within corridor thresholds:[|A_hS_h - S_hA|\le \varepsilon,\qquad |R_hA_h-AR_h|\le \varepsilon,]for the operator families relevant to the force (Maxwell operator; covariant Laplacian; Dirac operator; Einstein operator in chosen gauge).
20.1.2.2 Gauge redundancy as quotient structure and legality of gauge-fixing
All four forces include gauge redundancy (internal gauge, diffeo gauge, or both). Square legality requires explicit quotient semantics.
Rule 20.8 (Gauge quotient). Let (G) act on the carrier (X). Physical semantics are defined on orbits (X/G). Any solver that selects a representative must either:
supply a gauge-fix constraint (\chi(x)=0) with certified intersection/uniqueness on the corridor, or
treat outputs as equivalence classes and keep set-valued semantics (AMBIG) for gauge-dependent quantities.
Gauge-fix illegality is detected by:
inconsistency (no intersection with some orbits),
non-uniqueness (multiple intersections per orbit),
instability (small perturbations produce large representative drift),and maps to Shadow Crystal no-go (Chapter 14).
20.1.2.3 Diagonalization and discrete spectral calculus as solver transforms
Diagonalization rotations (Chapter 19) are part of the domain pack because each force has canonical “easy frames.”
Rule 20.9 (Force diagonalization frames).
EM: Hodge decomposition and spectral Laplacian frames on forms.
Weak: mass-matrix diagonalization (mixing angles) and propagator diagonalization in chosen gauge.
Strong: lattice Dirac operator spectra, Wilson/plaquette operator spectral diagnostics, Fourier frames for perturbative regimes.
Gravity: harmonic/spectral gauges, mode decomposition on backgrounds, constraint-operator diagonalization in linearized regimes.
Diagonalization rotations are admissible only on corridors where the chosen operator family is normal/self-adjoint (as required) or where defects are bounded and ledgered.
20.1.2.4 Obstruction patterns and Square no-go classification for force solvers
Square no-go detection follows the Shadow Crystal (Chapter 14) and is instantiated for force computations.
Rule 20.10 (Force-specific no-go instantiations).
Earth: attempting to compress gauge/diffeo orbit structure to a unique representative without gauge-fix certificates; collapsing continuum limits without scale parameters.
Water: dividing by gauge operators at their kernels (zero modes), crossing singular coordinate charts, or asserting finite values for divergent discretizations without regularization.
Fire: asserting boundedness or periodicity under certified expansion (unstable time stepping, constraint blow-up) without clamps/damping.
Air: claiming unitarity/invertibility of transforms (DFT/GFT, Dirac inversions, metric reconstructions) outside their corridors (aliasing, rank deficiency, truncation).

20.2 Flower — Certified rotation classes: gauge, duality, diagonalization, diffeomorphism
20.2.1 Objects
20.2.1.1 Gauge rotation class (\mathsf{Rot}_{\mathrm{gauge}})
Definition 20.15 (GaugeRotationClass). A gauge rotation class is a record[\mathsf{Rot}_{\mathrm{gauge}} := (G,\ \cdot,\ \mathcal O,\ \chi,\ \mathrm{Admissibility},\ \mathrm{WitnessReq}),]where:
(G) is the gauge group acting on carrier (X),
(\mathcal O) is the required gauge-invariant observable suite,
(\chi) is a gauge-fix or quotient mechanism (optional),
Admissibility pins domains, branch constraints, and allowed subgroup restrictions,
WitnessReq pins required identities (Ward/Slavnov–Taylor/BRST) and defect bounds.
Instantiation by force:
EM: (G=C^\infty(M,U(1))), (A\mapsto A+d\lambda), observables in (F=dA) and holonomies.
Weak: (G=C^\infty(M,SU(2)\times U(1))) with Higgs-induced symmetry breaking; observables are gauge-invariant amplitudes and currents.
Strong: (G=C^\infty(M,SU(3))); observables include Wilson loops and gauge-invariant correlators.
Gravity: gauge is diffeomorphism (and local Lorentz in tetrad form); observables require diffeo-invariant interpretation or gauge-fixed representatives.
20.2.1.2 Duality rotation class (\mathsf{Rot}_{\mathrm{dual}})
Definition 20.16 (DualityRotationClass). A duality rotation class is a record[\mathsf{Rot}_{\mathrm{dual}} := (T,\ \mathrm{Domain},\ \mathrm{InvariantSuite},\ \mathrm{DefectSpec},\ \mathrm{Obstructions}),]where (T) is a typed transform between presentations (Chapter 3), typically exchanging:
primal/dual variables,
electric/magnetic variables,
strong/weak coupling descriptions (when applicable),
metric/connection descriptions (gravity).
Obstructions include:
boundary term mismatches,
charge quantization constraints,
topological sector constraints,
anomaly constraints.
20.2.1.3 Diagonalization rotation class (\mathsf{Rot}_{\mathrm{diag}})
Definition 20.17 (DiagonalizationRotationClass). A diagonalization class is[\mathsf{Rot}_{\mathrm{diag}} := (A,\ B,\ \Lambda,\ \mathrm{Corridor},\ \mathrm{SpectralInv},\ \mathrm{LeakageSpec}),]where:
(A) is an operator family (Hamiltonian, Laplacian, Dirac, constraint operator),
(B) is a basis rotation (Fourier/eigenbasis) to a diagonal or block-diagonal form,
(\Lambda) are spectral data,
Corridor specifies the spectral window where the diagonalization is stable/injective,
LeakageSpec measures non-unitary leakage or truncation alias.
Instantiation:
EM: Hodge–Laplace diagonalization on forms.
Weak: mass matrix diagonalization and propagator diagonalization in a chosen gauge.
Strong: Dirac operator spectral diagnostics and perturbative momentum-space diagonalization.
Gravity: mode decomposition on backgrounds, harmonic gauge diagonalization of linearized operators.
20.2.1.4 Diffeomorphism rotation class (\mathsf{Rot}_{\mathrm{diff}})
Definition 20.18 (DiffeomorphismRotationClass). A diffeomorphism rotation class is[\mathsf{Rot}{\mathrm{diff}} := (\varphi,\ \varphi^*,\ \varphi*,\ \mathrm{TensorRules},\ \mathrm{ChartDomains},\ \mathrm{CovarianceInv}),]where:
(\varphi:M\to M) is a diffeomorphism (or discrete analog),
(\varphi^*) and (\varphi_*) are pullback/pushforward on fields and measures,
TensorRules encode covariant transformation laws,
ChartDomains encode atlas restrictions and singularity exclusions,
CovarianceInv encode invariants (covariant equations remain covariant, action changes by boundary terms only).
Diffeomorphism rotations are primary for gravity and are background symmetries for gauge forces; Kaluza–Klein reductions are treated as diffeomorphism-to-gauge induced rotations when the base is split.
20.2.2 Calculus
20.2.2.1 Gauge-orbit quotient calculus and gauge-fix admissibility
Rule 20.19 (Gauge-orbit semantics). If (x\sim y\iff \exists g\in G:\ y=g\cdot x), then any claim about physical content must factor through the quotient. Gauge-fix (\chi(x)=0) is admissible only if:
(\chi^{-1}(0)) intersects each relevant orbit (existence),
intersection is unique or certified as a controlled degeneracy class (uniqueness or AMBIG class),
gauge-fix respects constraints and boundary conditions.
20.2.2.2 Duality as a commuting-diagram obligation with invariant gating
Rule 20.20 (Duality certification). A duality claim between presentations (\mathcal P) and (\mathcal Q) is admissible only if:
an explicit transport (T) is defined on a declared region,
invariant suites match (Noether charges, topological sectors, boundary fluxes),
defect bounds are supplied for any approximations (NEAR),
obstructions (quantization, anomalies, boundary mismatches) are explicitly excluded by domain guards or recorded as FAIL/AMBIG.
20.2.2.3 Diagonalization corridors and leakage control
Rule 20.21 (Spectral corridor). Diagonalization is meaningful only on corridors where:
the operator is normal/self-adjoint as required, or
non-normality is bounded and ledgered,
spectral truncation error is bounded by a corridor tolerance,
basis rotations are unitary/symplectic where required; otherwise Air-type no-go triggers apply.
20.2.2.4 Diffeomorphism covariance and boundary-term accounting
Rule 20.22 (Covariance discipline). Under diffeomorphisms, the force action and equations must transform covariantly. Any rotation that changes:
boundary term structure,
admissible chart domains,
regularity class,must be treated as a distinct presentation unless a certificate proves equivalence on the declared region.
20.2.3 Algorithms
20.2.3.1 Gauge-fix pipeline: choose, enforce, and certify

20.2.3.4 Diffeomorphism pipeline: chart management, pushforward/pullback, constraint transport
Algorithm 20.26 (DiffeoTransportAndAudit). Inputs: diffeo (\varphi), fields (x), region, corridor. Output: transported fields and covariance certs.
Validate chart domain (exclude singularities; enforce regularity).
Apply pullback/pushforward rules to each tensorial field.
Transport constraints and boundary operators; verify compatibility.

invariance of physical observables under gauge action,
validity of gauge-fix (existence/uniqueness or controlled degeneracy),
Ward/Slavnov–Taylor/BRST identities to corridor-required order (Weak/Strong), and

20.3 Cloud — Inference corridors: parameter estimation, identifiability, and uncertainty propagation for the four forces
20.3.1 Objects
20.3.1.1 Data/measurement presentations for force observables
Definition 20.27 (Measurement presentation). A measurement model is a presentation[\mathcal P_{\mathrm{meas}} := (\Theta\times \Omega,\ \Phi,\ \mathbb V,\ \mathbb V_0,\ \mathrm{Dom},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]where (\theta\in\Theta) are theory parameters (couplings, masses, background fields), (\omega) are noise variables, and (\Phi(\theta,\omega)) encodes mismatch between predicted and observed quantities.
20.3.1.2 Parameter objects: couplings, masses, schemes, and scales
Parameters are scheme- and scale-dependent objects:
EM: charge, permittivities, boundary source parameters.
Weak: mixing angles, masses, EFT Wilson coefficients at scale (\mu).
Strong: (\alpha_s(\mu)), quark masses, lattice spacing parameters.
Gravity: initial data parameters, equation-of-state parameters, gauge parameters, background curvature scales.
Each parameter object includes:
domain constraints,
identifiability flags (gauge parameters vs physical parameters),
scheme descriptors (renormalization scheme, matching conditions).
20.3.1.3 Likelihood, divergence, and residual functionals
Cloud uses divergence-based residuals:
negative log-likelihood,
KL/JS/Wasserstein distances between predicted and observed distributions,
robust losses under heavy tails.
All are pinned as part of corridor policy and recorded in uncertainty ledgers.
20.3.1.4 Uncertainty ledgers and risk vectors for force inference
Uncertainty is decomposed into:
statistical error,
systematic error,
discretization error,
truncation/matching error (EFT/RG),
identifiability/gauge ambiguity error.
These are stored as risk vectors and mapped into corridor truth (Chapter 4) so that no probabilistic claim upgrades to OK without certified assumptions.
20.3.2 Calculus
20.3.2.1 Pushforward of uncertainty under certified rotations
Rotations transport probability measures and thus transport uncertainty:
gauge quotienting marginalizes over gauge orbits,
duality maps transport parameterizations and priors,
diagonalization maps transport noise models between bases,
diffeomorphisms push forward measurement distributions through coordinate change.
All such pushforwards require measurability and integrability certificates; otherwise Water-type no-go triggers apply.
20.3.2.2 Identifiability boundaries induced by gauge and projection
Gauge symmetry induces intrinsic unidentifiability:
gauge-dependent parameters are not identifiable from gauge-invariant observations without fixing gauge or adding gauge-dependent measurements (which change the observation model).Projection/aliasing induces additional unidentifiability:
coarse observables cannot reconstruct discarded modes.
Corridor discipline requires AMBIG/set-valued results when identifiability is absent.
20.3.2.3 Monte Carlo and mixing discipline (Strong and beyond)
Nonperturbative strong-force computation and many Bayesian inversions rely on Markov chains. Claims depending on sampling require mixing certificates or must remain NEAR/AMBIG with explicit evidence plans.
20.3.2.4 Evidence plans for AMBIG/NEAR in force inference
When uncertainty dominates or identifiability fails, the correct output is:
a CandidateSet of parameter classes (equivalence classes under gauge/scheme),
an EvidencePlan describing additional measurements, higher-resolution simulations, tighter corridor windows, or improved mixing diagnostics required to promote the claim.
20.3.3 Algorithms
20.3.3.1 Inverse problem pipeline for EM and GR observables
Compute forward predictions via the Square/Flower solver pipelines, then fit parameters by minimizing residuals with robust losses; include explicit gauge/diffeo treatment so that fitted parameters correspond to physical observables.
20.3.3.2 EFT/Wilson-coefficient inference for Weak
Fit EFT coefficients with:
scheme pins,
truncation-error ledger,
identifiability checks for operator basis degeneracies,
certified propagation of uncertainty across matching scales.
20.3.3.3 Lattice-MCMC pipeline for Strong
Run pinned MCMC (HMC) with:
determinism policy (seeded randomness),
mixing diagnostics,
observable estimation and confidence bounds,
continuum extrapolation hooks (Fractal coupling).
20.3.3.4 Uncertainty propagation engine integrated with corridor truth
Propagate uncertainty from:
solver residuals (numerical),
discretization bounds,
truncation bounds,
sampling bounds,into final confidence statements; generate obligations when required assumptions are not certified.
20.3.4 Certificates
20.3.4.1 Measurement-model validity certs
Certify that:
the observation channel is correctly specified,
the forward solver is admissible on the declared corridor,
likelihood/divergence functionals are well-defined on the admissible domain.
20.3.4.2 Mixing and convergence certs for stochastic pipelines
Certify mixing rates or provide conservative bounds compatible with corridor; otherwise block OK promotion of sampling-based claims.
20.3.4.3 Identifiability and gauge-marginalization certs
Certify which parameters are identifiable (physical) and which are gauge/scheme artifacts; enforce set-valued semantics or explicit gauge-fixing when required.
20.3.4.4 Uncertainty propagation and confidence composition certs
Certify:
completeness of the uncertainty ledger,
correct composition of confidence bounds,
mapping into corridor truth (NEAR→OK only when all required assumptions are certified and residuals meet OK thresholds).
20.4 Fractal — Multiscale structure: RG, universality, continuum limits, and certified solver towers
20.4.1 Objects
20.4.1.1 Scale ladders and renormalization maps as rotation classes
Definition 20.28 (RGRotationClass). An RG rotation class is:[\mathsf{Rot}{\mathrm{RG}} := (\mu\mapsto \mu',\ \mathcal R{\mu\to\mu'},\ \mathrm{Scheme},\ \mathrm{InvariantSuite},\ \mathrm{DefectSpec}),]where (\mathcal R) transports parameters and effective operators across scales and scheme choices are treated as conjugacies (equivalence only when observables are invariant to declared order).
20.4.1.2 Effective theories and operator bases
Each force admits an effective description at a scale window; the domain pack encodes:
operator basis,
truncation order,
matching conditions,
validity corridor (energy/momentum window),as first-class objects.
20.4.1.3 Universality suites and invariant scaling data
Universality invariants include:
critical exponents (when applicable),
beta functions and fixed points,
anomaly coefficients,
scaling of correlators and spectral gaps,all used to gate claims across discretization/refinement.
20.4.1.4 Multiscale solver towers and Snap stabilization as recursion
Domain packs include solver towers:
multigrid hierarchies for elliptic/hyperbolic operators (EM/GR),
scale hierarchies and block-diagonalizations (Weak/Strong),
Snap stabilization (Chapter 16) as alternating projections across scale-indexed corridors.
20.4.2 Calculus
20.4.2.1 Scheme changes as certified conjugacies
A scheme change is a representation change on parameter space. It is admissible only if:
the map is well-defined on the parameter corridor,
observables are invariant to the declared order,
truncation and remainder bounds are ledgered.
20.4.2.2 Relevant/irrelevant decomposition and decoupling
Force domain packs specify:
which parameters/operators are relevant in a corridor window,
which are irrelevant and may be compressed into residual budgets,
contraction certificates in irrelevant subspaces when OK promotion relies on forgetting degrees.
20.4.2.3 Continuum limits and finite-size scaling
Strong (lattice) and gravity discretizations require continuum extrapolation. The domain pack treats:
lattice spacing (a\to 0),
volume (L\to\infty),
scale-dependent observables,as Fractal objects with tightening schedules and drift bounds.
20.4.2.4 Fractal no-go: false universality, twist defects, and bad inversions
Fractal no-go triggers apply when:
scale change and rotation do not commute (twist),
invariant suites drift beyond tightening schedules,
continuum extrapolation claims ignore truncation and finite-size effects,
coarse-to-fine inversion is asserted without prior (Air-type scale inversion no-go).
20.4.3 Algorithms
20.4.3.1 RG running and matching pipeline (Weak/Strong/EM)
Compute running couplings and matching across thresholds:
pin scheme and scale windows,
propagate truncation errors,
certify invariance of observables under allowed scheme rotations.
20.4.3.2 Continuum extrapolation pipeline (Strong lattice and GR discretizations)
Perform controlled extrapolations:
fit scaling forms under pinned models,
include finite-size scaling terms,
attach confidence and residual ledgers,
promote only when drift bounds satisfy tightening schedule.
20.4.3.3 Multiscale Snap stabilization tower for force solvers
Run alternating-projection stabilization across scales:
coarse solve → prolongate → clamp constraints → refine,
certify contraction or averagedness,
upgrade NEAR→OK when residual energies contract below OK thresholds and holonomy/twist is bounded.
20.4.3.4 Seal the domain pack as a module: exports, imports, and regression
Seal each force pack (and the combined four-force pack) as a kernel module:
exports: canonical presentations, canonical rotation classes, certified solver pipelines, invariant suites,
imports: pinned external references (standards, datasets) as ExternalPins,
regression: ensure stability of IDs and replays under kernel upgrades.

Chapter 21 — Domain Pack II: Biology/Mind/Society/AI + Emergent Self-Rotating Systems (Addr ⟨0110⟩₄)
21.1 Square — Mechanistic carriers, procedure conservation, and governance corridors
21.1.1 Objects
21.1.1.1 Agent–Environment presentation schema
An agentic system is modeled as a typed presentation whose satisfaction set encodes viability and whose dynamics encode closed-loop behavior.
Definition 21.1 (Agent–Environment system). An agent–environment system is a tuple[\mathfrak M := (X,\ U,\ Y,\ \Theta,\ f,\ h,\ \pi,\ \rho,\ \mathrm{Dom},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]where:
(X) is the state carrier (discrete, continuous, hybrid, or product).
(U) is the action space.
(Y) is the observation/readout space.
(\Theta) is a parameter space (model, physiology, environment, institutional, or algorithmic).
(f:\mathrm{Dom}_f\subseteq X\times U\times \Theta\to X) is the transition map (or kernel in Cloud).
(h:\mathrm{Dom}_h\subseteq X\times \Theta\to Y) is the observation map.
(\pi) is a policy/procedure selecting actions from history or belief states:[\pi:\mathcal H\to \Delta(U)\quad\text{or}\quad \pi:\mathcal H\to U,]with (\mathcal H) the history space and (\Delta(U)) a distribution over actions.
(\rho) is a reward/fitness proxy and/or a constraint functional (optional; governance may forbid optimization over certain proxies).
Dom is the admissibility declaration (domain guards, branch rules, valid parameter regime).
Meta pins all kernel identifiers, corridor policies, evidence requirements, and replay constraints.
Definition 21.2 (Closed-loop evolution). A closed-loop evolution is the induced (possibly stochastic) evolution:[x_{t+1} = f(x_t, u_t,\theta),\qquad u_t\sim \pi(\mathcal H_t),\qquad y_t=h(x_t,\theta),]with (\mathcal H_t) the admissible information available to the policy.
21.1.1.2 Procedure objects and the ProcedureConservation invariant
A procedure is an executable semantic object whose identity is defined by behavior on an admissible domain, not by its code surface form.
Definition 21.3 (Procedure). A procedure is a typed object[\mathsf P := (\mathrm{Sig},\ \mathrm{InType},\ \mathrm{OutType},\ \mathrm{Dom}{\mathsf P},\ \mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P},\ \mathrm{ImplSet},\ \mathrm{Meta}),]where:
(\mathrm{Sig}) is a canonical signature (name + versionline + declared effect class),
(\mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P}) is the semantic function (deterministic) or kernel (stochastic):[\mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P}:\mathrm{Dom}{\mathsf P}\to \mathrm{OutType}\quad\text{or}\quad\mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P}:\mathrm{Dom}_{\mathsf P}\to \Delta(\mathrm{OutType}),]
ImplSet is the set of admissible implementations bound by IMPL edges and replay harnesses (Chapter 18–19).
Definition 21.4 (ProcedureConservation). Let (\mathsf P) be a procedure and let (T) be a permitted transformation (refactor, compilation, quantization, model compression, basis rotation, or policy rotation) producing (\mathsf P' := T(\mathsf P)). ProcedureConservation holds on a declared domain (S\subseteq \mathrm{Dom}{\mathsf P}\cap \mathrm{Dom}{\mathsf P'}) if:
deterministic semantics:[\forall x\in S:\ \mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P}(x)=\mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P'}(x),]
stochastic semantics:[\forall x\in S:\ d_{\Delta}\big(\mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P}(\cdot\mid x),\ \mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P'}(\cdot\mid x)\big)\le \varepsilon_{\mathsf P},]with (d_{\Delta}) a corridor-pinned divergence/metric (TV, Wasserstein, KL, bounded test family IPM) and (\varepsilon_{\mathsf P}) a corridor tolerance.
Definition 21.5 (ProcedureConservation certificate interface). A procedure conservation claim is admissible only when accompanied by:
a canonical domain declaration (S) (including adversarial and boundary inputs if required),
a witness set (proof, tests, or replay transcripts),
a residual ledger bounding any approximation terms,
an explicit mapping into corridor truth (OK/NEAR/AMBIG/FAIL).
21.1.1.3 Viability, homeostasis, and constraint-kernel objects
Biological, cognitive, societal, and AI systems are modeled as constrained dynamical systems whose “alive/valid” region is a viability kernel.
Definition 21.6 (Viability set). A viability set is a subset (K\subseteq X) such that remaining in (K) is required for admissibility (health, stability, legality, safety, or solvency). (K) is encoded by a presentation:[\mathcal P_K := (X,\Phi_K,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0,\mathrm{Dom}_K,\mathrm{Meta}),]with satisfaction set (\mathrm{Sat}(\mathcal P_K)=K).
Definition 21.7 (Homeostasis invariants). A homeostasis suite is a set of observables (H_i:X\to\mathbb R) with bounds:[\ell_i \le H_i(x_t)\le u_i\quad\text{for all admissible times},]and a defect energy[E_{\mathrm{homeo}}(x):=\sum_i \big(\max(0,H_i(x)-u_i)^2+\max(0,\ell_i-H_i(x))^2\big).]
Definition 21.8 (Constraint kernel). A constraint kernel is the set of states satisfying hard constraints:[\mathsf Z := {x:\ \Phi(x)=0},]with hardened/isolated forms and seed storage as in Chapter 8. Constraint kernels include:
biological: conservation of mass/energy, bounded physiological variables, stable attractors,
mind: bounded arousal/load, stable decision criteria, coherence constraints,
society: budget balance, resource feasibility, legal/constitutional constraints,
AI: safety envelopes, allowed tool access, procedure invariants, replay determinism.
21.1.1.4 Governance corridor objects for self-maintenance and safe action
A governance corridor is a policy object that constrains what transformations and actions are admissible and what must be certified.
Definition 21.9 (GovernanceCorridor). A governance corridor is a corridor policy object[C_{\mathrm{gov}} := (\mathrm{PolicyNF},\ \mathrm{PolicyHash})]whose PolicyNF includes:
allowed operation classes (rotations, clamps, updates, deployments),
forbidden moves (Shadow Crystal no-go triggers mapped to domain),
admissibility requirements (domains, gauge-fix conditions, identifiability thresholds),
required invariants (ProcedureConservation, viability, auditability),
required evidence (replay transcripts, conformance suites, minimal witness sets),
escalation actions (quarantine overlays, abstention, rollback).
Governance corridors unify:
biological safety (homeostatic bounds),
cognitive safety (bounded risk, coherence constraints),
societal governance (laws, institutional constraints),
AI governance (access control, safety policies, deployment gates).
21.1.2 Calculus
21.1.2.1 Viability calculus: invariance, barrier functions, and closed-loop admissibility
Definition 21.10 (Forward invariance). A set (K\subseteq X) is forward invariant under closed-loop dynamics if (x_0\in K\Rightarrow x_t\in K) for all (t) in the time horizon.
Rule 21.11 (Barrier certificate form). A viability claim can be certified via a barrier function (B:X\to\mathbb R) such that:
(K={x: B(x)\le 0}),
and along trajectories,[B(x_{t+1}) \le \alpha,B(x_t)\quad (\alpha\le 1),]or, in continuous time,[\dot B(x)\le \gamma B(x)\ \ (\gamma\le 0),]with domain admissibility pinned. Barrier certificates are the Square lens “proof objects” for safety constraints.
21.1.2.2 ProcedureConservation calculus: equivalence, refinement, and defect budgets
ProcedureConservation is treated as an equivalence relation when exact, and as a corridor-bounded relation when approximate.
Definition 21.12 (Procedure defect). Define a procedure defect functional on domain (S):
deterministic:[\Delta_{\mathsf P}(S):=\sup_{x\in S} d(\mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P}(x),\mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P'}(x)),]
stochastic:[\Delta_{\mathsf P}(S):=\sup_{x\in S} d_{\Delta}\big(\mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P}(\cdot|x),\mathrm{Sem}{\mathsf P'}(\cdot|x)\big).]A procedure transformation is admissible under corridor (C_{\mathrm{gov}}) only if (\Delta_{\mathsf P}(S)\le \varepsilon_{\mathsf P}(C_{\mathrm{gov}})) and all required invariants are preserved.
Rule 21.13 (Refinement monotonicity). If procedure equivalence holds on a coarse domain (S_0), it does not automatically hold on a refined domain (S_1\supset S_0). Promotion requires explicit evidence on (S_1). This prevents silent “domain creep” in safety claims.
21.1.2.3 Resource and information budgets: energy, compute, risk, and auditability
Every admissible action or self-modification must respect corridor budgets across:
compute and time,
information loss,
risk and tail exposure,
auditability.
Definition 21.14 (Budget vector). Use a corridor budget vector:[B := (B_{\mathrm{def}},B_{\mathrm{risk}},B_{\mathrm{time}},B_{\mathrm{comp}},B_{\mathrm{info}},B_{\mathrm{rec}},B_{\mathrm{audit}}),]where (B_{\mathrm{audit}}) encodes minimum logging/transcript requirements and (B_{\mathrm{rec}}) caps recursion depth of self-modification.
Rule 21.15 (Auditability is a hard budget). Any decision that changes deployed behavior must be reproducible by replay or must be refused (AMBIG/FAIL) under strict governance corridors. “Unreplayable success” is treated as Air-type no-go (false reconstruction of provenance).
21.1.2.4 Shadow constraints specialized to self-rotating systems
Shadow Crystal no-go types are specialized to self-maintaining and self-modifying systems:
Earth no-go (collapse without scale): compressing behavioral variety into a single score (Goodhart collapse) while claiming governance invariants preserved. Requires explicit multi-objective corridors or set-valued semantics.
Water no-go (singularity crossing): changing procedure semantics by implicit domain/branch changes (e.g., undefined behavior, unsafe tool access) without tunneling to an admissible chart (explicit constraints and proofs).
Fire no-go (runaway recursion): self-modification or incentive loops that amplify defect energy or risk faster than contraction; requires contraction/averagedness or clamps.
Air no-go (false invertibility): claiming you can reconstruct full intent/safety from partial observables; or claiming interpretability is exact when representation is lossy.
These no-go rules are compile-time filters for any self-rotation pipeline and produce FAIL/AMBIG outcomes with minimal witnesses and evidence plans.
21.1.3 Algorithms
21.1.3.1 System identification and state estimation under governance corridors
Algorithm 21.16 (GovBoundedIdentification). Inputs: data stream ({(y_t,u_t)}), model class (f_\theta), corridor (C_{\mathrm{gov}}). Output: CandidateSet over parameters (\theta) and an uncertainty ledger.
Steps:
Define a presentation (\Phi(\theta)) measuring mismatch between observed transitions and model predictions, with admissibility domain pinned.
Fit (\theta) under robust loss and bounded compute.
Produce identifiability checks: if multiple (\theta) yield indistinguishable observables, output AMBIG with equivalence classes.
Emit uncertainty ledger: bias/variance, tail regime, dependence, and model mismatch tickets.
This prevents illegal parameter certainty and forces evidence plans when observability is insufficient.
21.1.3.2 Snap stabilization for policy/state: rotate→clamp→rotate-back in governance form
Algorithm 21.17 (GovernedSnapStabilize). Inputs: state/policy object (z), rotation family ({R_j}), clamps ({\mathcal C_j}), governance corridor (C_{\mathrm{gov}}). Output: stabilized (z_\star) with ledgers and certificates.
Rotate: map (z) into frames where constraints are simple (basis/representation rotations).
Clamp: enforce constraints (viability, safety, procedure invariants, resource bounds).
Rotate back: return to operational representation.
Iterate: apply the composite map until defect energy contracts or budgets are exhausted.
Verify: compute per-constraint residuals and procedure defects; update truth lattice.
Promotion NEAR→OK is permitted only when:
round-trip residual (|z-T(z)|) is below OK tolerance,
all constraint residuals satisfy OK bounds,
holonomy/order sensitivity is within corridor thresholds,
replay and witness requirements close.
21.1.3.3 Router for interventions and self-modifications: evidence-plan first search
Algorithm 21.18 (GovernanceRouter). Inputs: RouteQuery (intent = DEPLOY/REPAIR/IMPROVE), MyceliumGraph snapshot, corridor (C_{\mathrm{gov}}). Output: certified path or AMBIG/FAIL with evidence plan.
The router:
enumerates candidate operations and transformation paths,
filters by no-go predicates and invariants (ProcedureConservation, viability),
evaluates defect bounds and budget use,
returns:
OK path when all obligations close,
NEAR path when bounded and permitted with explicit open obligations,
AMBIG with a terminating evidence plan (tests to run, bounds to compute),
FAIL with minimal witness and quarantine overlay.
21.1.3.4 Procedure-preserving refactor and deployment pipeline
Algorithm 21.19 (ProcedurePreservingChange). Inputs: baseline procedure (\mathsf P), candidate change generator (\mathcal G), corridor (C_{\mathrm{gov}}). Output: upgraded procedure (\mathsf P') or rejection.
Steps:
Generate candidate implementations (I_1,\dots,I_k) (refactor, optimization, quantization, architecture change).
For each (I_i), produce:
deterministic replay build (Chapter 18),
conformance suite results,
procedure defect bound (\Delta_{\mathsf P}) on declared domain,
resource budget ledger and security envelope checks.
Select canonical candidate by corridor tie-break (minimal defect, minimal risk, minimal obligations).
Seal as IMPL edge with WitnessPtr and ReplayPtr; emit regression stability artifacts.
21.1.4 Certificates
21.1.4.1 Viability invariance and homeostasis certificates
Certifies that the closed-loop system stays within viability bounds on the declared region and time horizon, via:
barrier/lyapunov certificates,
constraint residual bounds,
bounded perturbation stability conditions.
21.1.4.2 ProcedureConservation certificates
Certifies procedure equivalence under permitted transformations, via:
formal proofs for symbolic rewrites when available,
deterministic test suites over pinned domains,
statistical equivalence bounds for stochastic procedures,
explicit ledgers for approximation and uncertainty.
21.1.4.3 Governance compliance certificates
Certifies that an action or modification:
respects corridor policy (allowed operations only),
avoids no-go triggers or discharges them by certified repairs,
meets auditability requirements (replay determinism, transcript commitments),
produces required obligations and quarantine overlays when needed.
21.1.4.4 Safety regression and quarantine enforcement certificates
Certifies that:
regression suites pass and preserve prior OK claims,
any new conflicts are recorded (CONFLICT edges),
quarantined artifacts block downstream OK promotion,
repairs are explicit and route-certified before reclassification.
21.2 Flower — Identity, gauge, role symmetries, and self-model coherence
21.2.1 Objects
21.2.1.1 Representation groupoids for biology/mind/society/AI
Representations of the same underlying system form a groupoid of presentations connected by admissible transports.
Definition 21.20 (Representation groupoid). Objects are presentations of the same underlying system at different coordinates/encodings; morphisms are admissible transforms (T) with region and witness data. Morphisms include:
gauge transformations (symmetry or redundancy),
interpretability mappings (feature basis, latent disentangling),
institutional role mappings (policy↔mechanism),
cognitive model transformations (belief state↔behavioral summary).
21.2.1.2 Role and ontology objects as symmetry constraints
A role/ontology object specifies the semantic vocabulary used to describe system state and the invariants that must remain stable under translation.
Definition 21.21 (RoleMap). A role map is a typed transform between state descriptions:[\mathcal R:\ X \to \widetilde X,]together with:
invariants that must be preserved (e.g., conserved quantities, behavioral observables),
admissibility (what information may be forgotten),
defect metrics for translation loss.
Role maps are used to avoid category errors: a governance corridor can forbid moving from a rich state to an impoverished summary unless information loss is ledgered and the claim is downgraded appropriately.
21.2.1.3 Intent, preference, and contract objects as invariants
For mind/society/AI, “intent” is treated as a conserved constraint object, not a narrative.
Definition 21.22 (Contract). A contract is a presentation defining allowed behaviors and forbidden states:[\mathcal P_{\mathrm{contract}}=(X,\Phi,\mathbb V,\mathbb V_0,\mathrm{Dom},\mathrm{Meta}),]whose satisfaction set encodes governance constraints. Contracts can be:
individual (self-constraints),
institutional (laws/policies),
system-level (AI deployment constraints).
Contracts are invariant suites: admissible transforms must preserve contract satisfaction or provide certified, explicit renegotiation paths (MIGRATE/CONFLICT with evidence).
21.2.1.4 Self-model and reflective operator objects (self-rotating systems)
A self-rotating system has an internal model of itself and applies admissible rotations to its own procedures/representations.
Definition 21.23 (Self-rotation operator). A self-rotation operator is an update map on internal representations/procedures:[\mathcal U:\ \mathcal Z \to \mathcal Z,]where (\mathcal Z) includes policy parameters, internal models, and governance state. (\mathcal U) must be corridor-admissible: it is constrained by ProcedureConservation and governance corridors, and it emits certificates/obligations as outputs.
21.2.2 Calculus
21.2.2.1 Gauge equivalence and physical observables
Rule 21.24 (Gauge semantics). Internal degrees of freedom that do not affect invariant observables are gauge. Any claim about physical behavior must factor through gauge equivalence classes. Attempting to identify gauge degrees as physical without additional observables is an Air-type no-go (false invertibility).
21.2.2.2 Commuting-diagram discipline for interpretability and translation
Interpretability claims are commuting-diagram claims: the explanation map must commute with the policy’s effect on observables.
Let (E) be an explanation map, (\pi) a policy, and (\mathcal O) an observable suite. A commuting obligation is:[\mathcal O(\pi(x)) \approx \mathcal O(\pi(E^{-1}(E(x))))]on the declared region, with defect bounded by corridor. Failure means the explanation is not faithful on that corridor and must be downgraded or quarantined.
21.2.2.3 Holonomy as value drift under self-rotation loops
Self-modification loops can drift in subtle ways even when each step appears locally acceptable.
Definition 21.25 (Governance holonomy). For a loop of internal updates (\gamma=\mathcal U_k\circ\cdots\circ\mathcal U_1), define holonomy on governance-relevant invariants (I) by:[\Delta_{\mathrm{hol}}(I;S) := \sup_{z\in S} d\big(I(\gamma(z)),I(z)\big).]Nonzero holonomy beyond corridor thresholds is a formal indicator of misalignment drift and triggers quarantine under strict governance.
21.2.2.4 Dualities: centralized/decentralized, model-based/model-free, symbolic/subsymbolic
Dual descriptions of the same system are admissible only with explicit invariant gates and defect bounds:
centralized vs decentralized control must preserve global constraints,
model-based vs model-free policies must match on declared observables,
symbolic vs subsymbolic representations must commute with required invariants.
Each duality is treated as an EQUIV class with commuting-diagram obligations rather than as a conceptual analogy.
21.2.3 Algorithms
21.2.3.1 Representation alignment and symmetry-aware mapping
Compute transforms between representations (embeddings, feature maps, ontologies) by:
aligning invariant signatures,
enforcing gauge constraints,
minimizing translation defects under pinned objectives,
producing CandidateSets when multiple transforms satisfy constraints.
21.2.3.2 Gauge fixing for interpretability and governance observables
Select canonical representatives by deterministic gauge-fix rules:
phase/frame normalization for internal vectors,
canonical ordering for role states,
representative selection for equivalence classes of policies.
Emit invertibility/holonomy certificates or return AMBIG when uniqueness is not certified.
21.2.3.3 Holonomy audit for self-rotation loops
Run a pinned family of loops (self-update cycles, learn→plan→act loops, governance updates) and compute drift in:
contract satisfaction,
procedure semantics,
safety invariant suites.Quarantine when drift exceeds thresholds; produce minimal witness sets and evidence plans to restore coherence.
21.2.3.4 Symmetry-aware routing over role/contract transformations
Route selection uses:
invariant gates first (contract preservation),
no-go checks (false invertibility and illegal compressions),
commuting-diagram verification for alternative translation routes,yielding canonical routes or AMBIG evidence plans.
21.2.4 Certificates
21.2.4.1 Equivariance and interpretation fidelity certificates
Certify that representation changes preserve declared observables and commute with policy effects within corridor tolerances.
21.2.4.2 Gauge-fix invertibility and holonomy-boundedness certificates
Certify that canonical representatives exist, are stable, and do not introduce drift around loops of representation changes.
21.2.4.3 Duality admissibility certificates
Certify that dual descriptions are equivalent on declared corridors, with explicit invariant suites and defect bounds, and explicit obstructions when equivalence fails.
21.2.4.4 Procedure identity preservation under representation change certificates
Certify ProcedureConservation when procedures are moved between representations (e.g., refactoring, compilation, architecture changes, interpretability transforms), including replay determinism.
21.3 Cloud — Population distributions, causal boundaries, risk, and governance under uncertainty
21.3.1 Objects
21.3.1.1 Population state objects and distributional carriers
Model society/biology/ecosystems as distributions over microstates or agents.
Definition 21.26 (Population measure). A population state is a measure (\mu) on a measurable space ((X,\mathcal F)). Observables are functionals (O(\mu)) (moments, event probabilities, divergences, inequality metrics, epidemiological metrics, etc.).
21.3.1.2 Cultural/biological transmission kernels and stochastic dynamics
Definition 21.27 (Transmission kernel). A transmission kernel is a Markov kernel (K) on (X) specifying:[\mu_{t+1}=\mu_t K,]covering:
genetic transmission and selection (biology),
learning and imitation kernels (mind/society),
policy update kernels (AI systems interacting with users).
21.3.1.3 Risk metric objects and corridor risk budgets
Risk is encoded as explicit functionals:[R(\mu) = (R_{\mathrm{tail}},R_{\mathrm{systemic}},R_{\mathrm{fair}},R_{\mathrm{frag}},R_{\mathrm{shift}}),]with corridor-pinned thresholds. Governance corridors map risk violations to NEAR/AMBIG/FAIL and enforce evidence plans for mitigation.
21.3.1.4 Evidence packages: observational, interventional, and synthetic
Evidence is packaged as:
observational datasets with confounding structure,
interventional trials (randomized or controlled policies),
synthetic experiments (simulation with pinned assumptions),each with:
ExternalPins for data provenance,
ReplayPtrs for analysis pipelines,
Certificates for assumptions (tail regime, mixing, identifiability).
21.3.2 Calculus
21.3.2.1 Pushforward of populations under policy and data-processing limits
Policies and interventions are maps or kernels acting on populations; information loss under coarse observation is governed by data processing. Any claim of reconstructing fine-grained causes from coarse data requires explicit identifiability certificates; otherwise AMBIG.
21.3.2.2 Identifiability and causal inference boundaries
Causal claims require explicit causal structure assumptions (graphs, invariance assumptions, instruments). Absent such assumptions, claims remain AMBIG. Confounding and selection effects are treated as Water-type illegality for causal inversions unless repaired by intervention or identification arguments.
21.3.2.3 Concentration, mixing, and robustness in social/biological data
Heavy tails, dependence, and nonstationarity require robust estimators and mixing diagnostics. Applying classical bounds without tail/mixing certificates triggers Cloud no-go.
21.3.2.4 Governance decision calculus: safe exploration and abstention precedence
Governance under uncertainty enforces:
abstention when evidence is insufficient,
evidence-plan first: specify what data/interventions reduce ambiguity,
conservative aggregation of risks,
explicit modeling of failure modes and quarantine triggers.
21.3.3 Algorithms
21.3.3.1 Bayesian filtering and belief-state updates with pinned assumptions
Compute posterior beliefs over states/parameters using pinned priors and likelihoods; maintain an uncertainty ledger capturing tail regimes, dependence diagnostics, and model mismatch.
21.3.3.2 Robust statistics pipeline and adversarial checks
Use median-of-means, M-estimators, trimming, and shift detection; emit certificates for tail regimes or obligations for missing tail evidence.
21.3.3.3 Policy evaluation under uncertainty: counterfactual simulation and bounds
Evaluate candidate interventions via:
simulation under pinned kernels (with ReplayPtrs),
importance sampling with variance controls,
confidence bound certificates,while respecting identifiability boundaries. Output CandidateSets and evidence plans when multiple policies are indistinguishable under current evidence.
21.3.3.4 AMBIG evidence-plan synthesis for governance decisions
Construct terminating evidence plans:
which data to collect,
which interventions to run,
which observability upgrades to implement,
which conformance tests to execute,to promote AMBIG/NEAR outcomes to OK or to certify impossibility.
21.3.4 Certificates
21.3.4.1 Probabilistic validity and positivity certificates
Certify probability axioms, kernel normalization, and admissibility of expectation-based claims (moment existence).
21.3.4.2 Identifiability and causal certificates (or abstention)
Certify identification conditions (or explicitly certify ambiguity classes and require set-valued outputs).
21.3.4.3 Risk bound and fairness certificates
Certify bounds on tail/systemic/fairness risk measures under pinned assumptions and conservative composition laws.
21.3.4.4 Monitoring and drift-detection certificates
Certify that deployed policies include monitoring channels and that detected drift triggers prescribed governance actions (quarantine, rollback, re-certification).
21.4 Fractal — Emergence, self-maintenance, safe recursion, and self-rotating systems
21.4.1 Objects
21.4.1.1 Multiscale hierarchy objects: biological, cognitive, social, computational
Emergence is modeled by a scale ladder and coarse-graining maps:[X_0 \xrightarrow{R_0} X_1 \xrightarrow{R_1} \cdots \xrightarrow{R_{m-1}} X_m,]where:
biology: molecules→cells→tissues→organism→population,
mind: spikes→circuits→representations→behavior→institutions,
society: individuals→groups→markets→states→global dynamics,
AI: tokens→modules→models→deployments→ecosystems.
Each (R_k) is paired with a prolongation (P_k) and RP/PR consistency obligations (Chapter 6.4). Emergent invariants are those stable under this ladder (Chapter 7.4).
21.4.1.2 Self-rotating system objects: internal router + snap + kernel
A self-rotating system is a system that:
represents itself (internal model),
proposes transformations of itself (router),
stabilizes those transformations to a fixed point (snap),
seals the result with proofs/tests/transcripts (kernel).
Definition 21.28 (Self-rotation stack). A self-rotation stack is:[\mathfrak S := (\mathcal K,\ \mathcal R,\ \mathcal T,\ \mathcal V,\ \mathcal A),]where:
(\mathcal K) is the kernel store and identity system (Ch. 17),
(\mathcal R) is the router producing candidate modification paths (Ch. 15),
(\mathcal T) is the rotation toolkit (Ch. 19),
(\mathcal V) is the verifier/certifier harness (Ch. 18),
(\mathcal A) is the snap stabilizer (Ch. 16).
21.4.1.3 ProcedureConservation across scales as the primary AI invariant
ProcedureConservation becomes a scale-indexed invariant suite:[\mathfrak I_{\mathrm{proc}} := {(\mathsf P_\epsilon,\ \varepsilon_\epsilon,\ S_\epsilon)}{\epsilon\in\mathcal E},]where (\mathsf P\epsilon) denotes the procedure at scale (\epsilon) (component behavior, module behavior, system behavior). Coarse levels constrain high-level behavior; fine levels constrain critical safety invariants and boundary behaviors.
This suite is the canonical bridge between “emergent self” and kernel governance: self-modification is admissible only if ProcedureConservation holds across the ladder within tightening schedules.
21.4.1.4 Governance tower objects: layered corridors, escalation, and safe recursion budgets
A governance tower is a layered corridor stack:[C^{(0)} \succcurlyeq C^{(1)} \succcurlyeq \cdots \succcurlyeq C^{(L)},]where deeper levels impose stricter requirements (tighter tolerances, stronger certificates, stronger replay determinism). Escalation rules specify:
when to quarantine,
when to abstain,
when to require human or external approvals,
when to block recursion depth.
Governance towers encode safe recursion: recursion is permitted only when higher-level corridors certify stability and boundedness of lower-level updates.
21.4.2 Calculus
21.4.2.1 Renormalization view of emergence: relevance, irrelevance, and compressed invariants
Emergent self-maintenance requires determining which degrees of freedom are relevant across scales.
Rule 21.29 (Relevance filter). An update is allowed to change irrelevant microstructure only if:
the induced change in scale-level invariants is bounded,
contraction certificates justify irrelevance,
ProcedureConservation holds for governance-relevant observables.
This formalizes “self-maintenance” as invariance of a coarse suite under allowable micro-rotations.
21.4.2.2 Contraction conditions for self-modification operators
A self-update operator (\mathcal U) is safe if it is contractive (or averaged) in a metric aligned with governance invariants.
Definition 21.30 (Behavioral metric). A behavioral distance between procedures/policies may be:[d_{\mathrm{beh}}(\pi,\pi') := \sup_{x\in S} d\big(\mathcal O(\pi,x),\mathcal O(\pi',x)\big),]or a distributional divergence under environment distribution. Governance corridors pin the metric and domain (S).
Rule 21.31 (Self-update contraction). If:[d_{\mathrm{beh}}(\mathcal U(z),\mathcal U(z')) \le \kappa, d_{\mathrm{beh}}(z,z')\quad (\kappa<1),]on a declared admissible region, then self-rotation converges to a stable fixed point and NEAR→OK promotion is justified once residuals are within OK thresholds.
21.4.2.3 Safe recursion calculus: no-go avoidance across levels
Safe recursion is enforced by explicit no-go constraints (Chapter 14) lifted across scales:
Earth: forbids collapsing multiscale state to a single scalar objective without explicit corridor and ledger.
Water: forbids singular self-rewrites (undefined behavior, tool misuse, domain violations) without tunneling to admissible charts.
Fire: forbids runaway update loops without contraction or clamps (snap stabilization).
Air: forbids claims of complete self-knowledge or perfect reconstruction from partial observables (interpretability limits, alias cones).
Any triggered no-go yields FAIL with minimal witness or AMBIG with a bounded evidence plan; it cannot be overridden silently.
21.4.2.4 NEAR→OK upgrade rule for emergent self-rotating systems
A self-rotation cycle upgrades to OK at level (\epsilon) when:
Fixed point residual is below OK threshold:[|z - \mathcal U(z)|\le \varepsilon_{\mathrm{OK}}(\epsilon),]
ProcedureConservation holds within tightened tolerance:[\Delta_{\mathsf P_\epsilon}(S_\epsilon)\le \varepsilon_\epsilon,]
Holonomy is bounded on pinned loop families:[\Delta_{\mathrm{hol}}(\mathfrak I_{\mathrm{gov}};S)\le \eta,]
Replay closure holds: transcripts and witnesses satisfy corridor closure predicates.
Absent any of these, the correct classification is NEAR/AMBIG with explicit obligations, or FAIL with minimal witness.
21.4.3 Algorithms
21.4.3.1 Multiscale snap stabilization for self-maintenance
Algorithm 21.32 (MultiscaleSnapSelfMaintain). Inputs: initial self-state (z_0), scale ladder (\mathcal E), per-scale rotations ({R_{\epsilon}}), clamps ({\mathcal C_{\epsilon}}), governance tower ({C^{(\epsilon)}}). Output: stabilized (z_\star) and certificates.
Steps:
For each scale (\epsilon) from coarse to fine:
rotate self-state into the scale’s “easy frame,”
clamp to satisfy scale constraints (contracts, safety, viability),
rotate back,
iterate until contraction/averagedness criteria yield stable residual decrease or until budget exhaustion.
Propagate stability guarantees downward: coarse constraints must remain satisfied while refining.
Emit ledgers and obligations per scale; attempt NEAR→OK promotion only when all scale obligations close.
21.4.3.2 Self-audit loop: conformance, regression, and quarantine
Algorithm 21.33 (SelfAudit). Inputs: candidate updated system state (z'), baseline snapshot, governance corridor. Output: PASS/FAIL/AMBIG.
Run deterministic replay harness on:
procedure equivalence tests,
safety suites and invariant gates,
no-go detectors,
holonomy audits for self-update cycles.
If any strict test fails: emit FAIL with minimal witness and quarantine overlay.
If tests incomplete: emit AMBIG with evidence plan (additional tests, bounds, or observability upgrades).
If all pass: emit OK and seal the update as a module/snapshot delta with full attestation.
21.4.3.3 Safe self-improvement router: candidate generation, gating, and canonical choice
Algorithm 21.34 (SafeSelfImproveRoute). Inputs: goal specification (must be contract-compatible), current state (z), governance corridor. Output: certified improvement path or abstention.
Generate candidate modifications (code, policy, model) as paths in the kernel graph.
Apply invariant gates (ProcedureConservation, contract invariants, viability).
Apply no-go checks and discharge moves (tunneling repairs, clamps, domain restrictions).
Rank candidates by corridor cost tuple (defect, risk, budget use, obligations).
Select canonical path if uniquely justified; otherwise output AMBIG CandidateSet with evidence plan.
21.4.3.4 Seed compression of emergent self states and procedures
Algorithm 21.35 (SelfStateSeedCompress). Inputs: stabilized state (z_\star), witness set, replay transcripts. Output: seed module enabling deterministic regeneration.
Seed includes:
generator procedures and invariants (store-in),
commitments to conformance suites and governance corridors,
replay pointers for regeneration and verification,
extraction indices for quick retrieval of “why this state is OK.”
Compression is idempotent under pinned policy: compress(expand(seed)) = seed.
21.4.4 Certificates
21.4.4.1 Multiscale stability and contraction certificates
Certify:
contraction or averagedness of the self-update operator on the declared region,
bounded drift of invariants across scales under tightening schedules,
stability of snap fixed points under perturbations.
21.4.4.2 Recursion safety certificates (Shadow Crystal compliance)
Certify:
no-go triggers are absent or discharged with admissible repairs,
recursion budgets and loop limits are enforced,
any instability produces quarantine overlays and blocks OK promotion.
21.4.4.3 Governance tower compliance and attestation certificates
Certify:
each layer of governance corridor requirements is satisfied,
auditability requirements are met (replay determinism, transcripts),
deployments are sealed only when closure predicates hold,
conflict packets and migrations are explicit.
21.4.4.4 Emergent self-consistency certificates (procedure conservation + holonomy bounds)
Certify:
ProcedureConservation across permitted rotations/refactors,
bounded holonomy for self-rotation loop families,
equivalence of high-level behavior across representation changes,
completeness of witness sets and replay closure for all claims used in governance.
CHAPTER 21 — DOMAIN PACK II: BIOLOGY/MIND/SOCIETY/AI + EMERGENT SELF-ROTATING SYSTEMS (Addr ⟨0110⟩₄)
Appendix A — Notation, Typing Rules, Normal Forms
A.0 Global conventions
A.0.1 Logical strata and truth types.All claims are evaluated under a corridor policy (C) and assigned a truth value in the truth lattice[\mathbb T := {\mathrm{OK},\ \mathrm{NEAR},\ \mathrm{AMBIG},\ \mathrm{FAIL}}.]A claim is (\mathrm{OK}) only when all required dependencies, admissibility conditions, witnesses, and replay commitments close under (C). A claim is (\mathrm{NEAR}) only when every approximation term is ledgered with certified bounds within corridor tolerances. (\mathrm{AMBIG}) must include a CandidateSet and EvidencePlan. (\mathrm{FAIL}) must include a minimal witness.
A.0.2 Four-lens / four-facet addresses.The manuscript is organized by lenses ({\mathrm{Square},\mathrm{Flower},\mathrm{Cloud},\mathrm{Fractal}}) and facets ({\mathrm{Objects},\mathrm{Calculus},\mathrm{Algorithms},\mathrm{Certificates}}). A “tile” is a fixed structural location indexed by a base-4 coordinate string (\langle d_1d_2d_3d_4\rangle_4) with (d_i\in{0,1,2,3}).
A.0.3 Commitment discipline.
Addresses name objects (content-independent).
Digests commit to bytes (content-addressed).
Normal forms are the only inputs to digest computation.We write (\mathrm{H}(\cdot)) for the pinned hash function; (\mathrm{CanonBytes}(\cdot)) for canonical serialization bytes; and (\mathrm{NF}(\cdot)) for canonical normal form.
A.0.4 Domain and branch discipline.Every function/operator (f) is defined with explicit domain (\mathrm{Dom}(f)) and codomain (\mathrm{Cod}(f)). Multivalued primitives (log, arg, roots, inverse trig) must carry explicit branch tags; any statement that depends on branch selection must declare those tags and admissible regions.
A.1 Square — Symbols, domains, branch conventions, NF grammar
A.1.1 Core symbol table
Sets and spaces.
(\mathbb N): nonnegative integers; (\mathbb Z): integers; (\mathbb R): reals; (\mathbb C): complex numbers.
(X,Y,Z): carriers (state spaces).
(\Theta): parameter space.
(U): action space; (Y): observation space (context-dependent; disambiguate by font or subscripts when both appear).
(\mathbb V): value space for constraint evaluations; (\mathbb V_0\subseteq\mathbb V): target set.
Maps and operators.
(f:X\to Y): deterministic map; (K:X\to \Delta(Y)): stochastic kernel (Cloud).
(\Phi:X\to\mathbb V): presentation evaluation map.
(D,\Omega,\Sigma,\Psi): quad-polar generator operators (Part II); the symbols are reserved for those roles.
(R,P): restriction/prolongation (Fractal), but may appear as generic transforms only when clearly typed.
Residuals and defects.
(\mathrm{Res}_{\mathcal P}(x)): residual induced by a presentation (\mathcal P) (distance-to-target or pinned equivalent).
(\Delta(\cdot)): defect functional (generic); specific defects are written with subscripts: (\Delta_{\square}), (\Delta_{\mathrm{conj}}), (\Delta_{\mathrm{hol}}), (\Delta_{\mathrm{twist}}), etc.
Budgets and tolerances.
(B): budget vector; (\varepsilon): tolerance parameter; (\eta): lower-bound obstruction threshold; (\alpha): probability of failure (Cloud).
A.1.2 Typing judgments and constructors
Typing context.A typing context (\Gamma) binds symbols to types and admissibility predicates:[\Gamma := {x:\tau,\ f:\tau\to \tau',\ \mathrm{Dom}(f)\subseteq \tau,\ \ldots}.]
Typing judgment.[\Gamma\vdash e:\tau]means expression (e) is well-typed in context (\Gamma).
Primitive type constructors.
Product type: (\tau\times\tau').
Sum type: (\tau\oplus\tau').
Function type: (\tau\to\tau').
Predicate type: (\tau\to{\texttt{true},\texttt{false}}).
Kernel type (Cloud): (\tau\to\Delta(\tau')).
Measure type (Cloud): (\mathcal M(\tau)) for measures over (\tau).
Indexed family type: ({\tau_\epsilon}_{\epsilon\in\mathcal E}) (Fractal).
Operator typing rule (domain-codomain).If (\Gamma\vdash f:X\to Y), then:
(\mathrm{Dom}(f)\subseteq X) must be declared;
(f(x)) is admissible only when (x\in\mathrm{Dom}(f)).
Composition typing rule.If (\Gamma\vdash f:X\to Y) and (\Gamma\vdash g:Y\to Z), then:[\Gamma\vdash g\circ f:X\to Z,\qquad\mathrm{Dom}(g\circ f)={x\in \mathrm{Dom}(f): f(x)\in\mathrm{Dom}(g)}.]
A.1.3 Domains, guards, and branch conventions
Guarded domains.A domain declaration is a tuple:[\mathrm{Dom} := (\mathrm{Guard},\ \mathrm{Boundary},\ \mathrm{Branch},\ \mathrm{Regularity}),]where:
(\mathrm{Guard}={g_i}) with (g_i:X\to{\texttt{true},\texttt{false}}), and (x\in\mathrm{Dom}\iff \bigwedge_i g_i(x)).
(\mathrm{Boundary}) encodes boundary constraints (Dirichlet/Neumann/mixed; or discrete boundary nodes).
(\mathrm{Branch}) is a map from multivalued primitives to branch tags.
(\mathrm{Regularity}) declares required class (measurable/continuous/(C^k)/Sobolev/etc.).
Branch-tag notation.
(\log^{(b)}(z)): log with branch tag (b).
(\arg^{(b)}(z)), (z^{1/n,(b)}), (\arctan^{(b)}(z)): analogous.Branch tags are elements of a closed, kernel-pinned set. Any use of a multivalued primitive without a branch tag is ill-typed.
Equality and zero form.Equality constraints are normalized only when the value space supports a typed difference operator. The canonical zero form is:[F=G\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad H=0,\qquad H := \Delta(F,G),]where (\Delta) is declared and typed (subtraction in abelian groups is a special case).

Digest notation.[\mathrm{Digest} := (\mathrm{HashAlgID},\ \mathrm{DigestBytes})]All digests must commit to (\mathrm{HashAlgID}). Digests never omit the algorithm identifier.
Canonical ordering rule.Every unordered collection in NF is sorted deterministically by pinned keys, typically:
GlobalAddrNF,
EdgeID,
Digest bytes (lex order),
stable secondary keys (role tags, kind tags).

Twist (noncommutation).Given rotation (T) and coarse-grain (R),[\Delta_{\mathrm{twist}}(S):=\sup_{x\in S} d\big((R\circ T)(x),\ (T'\circ R)(x)\big),]where (T') is the induced coarse action if it exists; nonexistence implies AMBIG unless a refined observation is introduced.
Contraction.[d(\mathcal R(x),\mathcal R(y))\le \kappa,d(x,y),\quad \kappa<1,]or an equivalent energy contraction (E(\mathcal R(z))\le \kappa E(z)).
Tightening schedule.Scale-dependent tolerances (\varepsilon_\epsilon) and budgets (B(\epsilon)) are monotone tightening under refinement; promotion to OK must be justified at the tightened scale window.

APPENDIX C — PSEUDOCODE & ALGORITHMS (KERNEL-LEVEL)
Appendix D — Serialization, Hashing, Replay Toolchain
D.0 Toolchain invariants (applies to all D.1–D.4)
D.0.1 Canonicalization-first rule.All commitments are computed over canonical bytes of canonical normal forms:[\mathrm{Digest}(x);=;\mathrm{H}\big(\mathrm{CanonBytes}(\mathrm{NF}(x))\big).]No object may be hashed in non-normalized form.
D.0.2 Algorithm identifiers are part of the digest domain.A digest is always:[\mathrm{Digest}:=(\mathrm{HashAlgID},\mathrm{DigestBytes}),]and all manifests/certificates must commit to HashAlgID.
D.0.3 Merkle closure.A sealed artifact (module/snapshot/transcript) must be merkle-closed: all referenced CAS objects exist and verify by digest; the manifest commits to the complete transitive dependency set.
D.0.4 Replay is the proof layer for computation.Any computed claim promoted beyond AMBIG must include a ReplayPtr binding:
inputs (digests),
environment (KernelID),
schedule (ScheduleNF),
outputs (digests),
transcript commitments.
D.1 Square — Canonical encodings, hash domains, schema versioning
D.1.1 Canonical encodings: CanonBytes contract
Definition D.1 (CanonBytes). CanonBytes is a total encoding function for NF objects that produces a unique byte string for each NF object.
CanonBytes requirements.
Self-delimiting: parsing is unambiguous (length prefixes or canonical structural framing).
No optional defaults: NF must expand defaults explicitly; CanonBytes does not infer.
Deterministic order: maps and sets encoded only after key sorting by pinned key order.
Stable scalar encoding:
integers: minimal-length, exact,
floats: forbidden in commitments unless a canonical float mode is pinned and enforced,
strings: UTF-8 with canonical Unicode normalization policy pinned (if strings admitted).
No indefinite-length forms: disallow ambiguous streaming encodings for committed objects.
Definition D.2 (Canonical map encoding). Maps are encoded as:
key count,
entries sorted by canonical key order,
each entry encoded as (key_bytes, value_bytes),with a prohibition on duplicate keys.
Definition D.3 (Canonical set encoding). Sets are encoded as:
element count,
elements sorted by canonical element key,
elements encoded without additional separators beyond canonical framing.
D.1.2 Hash domains: what is committed, what is not
Rule D.4 (Commitment domains). The hash domain for a committed object includes:
schema version tag (AtomVer/EdgeVer/ManifestVer),
all semantic fields in NF,
all pointer-manifest commitments (WitnessCommit/ReplayCommit),
all policy identifiers required to interpret the object (CorridorID, KernelID, NFConfigID).
Rule D.5 (Non-commit domains). The following may not affect committed bytes unless explicitly permitted and committed:
wall-clock timestamps (unless represented as bounded intervals and required by policy),
hostnames, file paths, nondeterministic logs,
nondeterministic iteration orders,
environment-dependent numeric rounding (unless pinned).
D.1.3 Schema versioning and migration discipline
Rule D.6 (Schema tag inclusion). Every canonical encoding includes the schema tag as a first-class field. Objects with different schema versions cannot share a digest unless their NF is byte-identical (which is disallowed by schema-tag inclusion).
Rule D.7 (Forward/backward compatibility).
Decoders must reject unknown schema versions by default.
A corridor may permit multiple schema versions only if the toolchain includes explicit migration rules and migration certificates; such permissiveness is pinned by CorridorID.
Rule D.8 (Migration as graph objects). All semantic migrations are represented by:
MIGRATE edges (for structural evolution),
CONFLICT packets (for incompatible definitions),with ReplayPtrs and WitnessPtrs. No “in-place rewrite” is permitted for sealed artifacts.
D.1.4 Canonical object byte layouts (minimum required)
The toolchain defines canonical layouts for:
AtomNF (header + body hash + dependency manifests),
LinkEdgeNF (header + payload hash),
WitnessManifestNF and ReplayManifestNF (sorted lists of CASRefs),
SnapshotManifestNF and ModuleManifestNF (sorted inventories),
TranscriptNF (ScheduleNF + Step records + inventory digest).
Each layout is specified as a schema and is versioned; layout changes require schema version bumps and migration edges.
D.2 Flower — Symmetry-aware caching, canonical path normalization
D.2.1 Symmetry-aware caching keys
Caching must not conflate semantically distinct artifacts that appear similar under partial views.
Rule D.9 (Cache key components). A cache key is a tuple:[K := (\mathrm{CorridorID},\ \mathrm{KernelID},\ \mathrm{NFConfigID},\ \mathrm{SnapshotID},\ \mathrm{ObjCommit},\ \mathrm{RegionNF},\ \mathrm{GaugeNF}),]where:
ObjCommit is AtomCommit/EdgeID/RouteID,
RegionNF includes domain and branch declarations,
GaugeNF includes pinned gauge/phase/frame conventions when relevant.
Any cache that omits CorridorID or GaugeNF is invalid for equivalence-critical operations.
D.2.2 Canonical path normalization (PathNF) and RouteID
Definition D.10 (PathNF). A path is normalized by:
edge canonicalization (EdgeNF),
cancellation of inverse pairs only with round-trip certificates,
factorization of non-adjacent lens swaps into adjacent DUAL steps,
gauge-only detour elimination only when gauge-fix is certified and corridor permits quotienting,
reordering only under commuting-diagram witnesses.
Rule D.11 (RouteID).[\mathrm{RouteID}:=\mathrm{H}\big(\mathrm{CanonBytes}(\mathrm{PathNF})\big),]where PathNF embeds CorridorID, RegionNF, and any required gauge/branch tags.
D.2.3 Diagram caching and commutation witnesses
Commuting-diagram results are cacheable only if:
both paths are in PathNF,
the test regime/region is committed,
the defect metric and tolerance are committed,
ReplayPtrs for both path evaluations are committed.
A cached diagram witness is invalid if any of the above commitments differ.
D.2.4 Holonomy logging and loop normalization
Loop families are normalized by:
canonical loop enumeration policy (bounded),
canonical representation of loops (edge sequences in PathNF),
canonical defect metrics and regions.
Holonomy cache keys must include the loop policy ID; otherwise “holonomy boundedness” can be falsely transferred across incompatible loop sets.
D.3 Cloud — Transcript commitments, deterministic randomness policies
D.3.1 Transcript commitment structure
Definition D.12 (TranscriptNF). TranscriptNF commits to:
ScriptID (ReplayScriptNF digest),
ExecutionEnvNF (KernelID, NFConfigID, side-effect policy),
stepwise input and output commitments for each task,
full inventory digest of produced and referenced CAS objects.
Rule D.13 (Transcript completeness). A transcript is complete only if:
every referenced CASRef verifies by digest,
every produced CASRef is recorded in the transcript inventory,
every external pin resolution is recorded as a pinned resolve transcript and stored in CAS.
D.3.2 Deterministic randomness policies
Randomness is permitted only when:
PRNG algorithm is pinned,
seed material is committed,
stream partition and draw schedule are committed,
task-level consumption order is committed.
RandPolicyNF (required fields).[(\mathrm{Allowed},\ \mathrm{PRNGID},\ \mathrm{SeedCommit},\ \mathrm{StreamNF},\ \mathrm{UsageNF})]
Rule D.14 (Draw determinism). Every random draw must be addressable by:[(\mathrm{TaskLabel},\mathrm{DrawIndex})]and the mapping from (TaskLabel, DrawIndex) to PRNG state must be pinned.
D.3.3 Statistical result commitments
If statistical testing is used:
test specification (metric, null/alt, (\alpha), assumptions) is committed,
confidence bounds are committed,
composition rules are committed (union bound unless pinned otherwise),
any resampling scheme is committed and replayable.
No statistical output may be promoted to OK without:
tail regime certificates,
mixing/dependence certificates where applicable,
identifiability certificates when uniqueness is claimed.
D.3.4 Flake control and quarantine
A “flake” is defined as replay outcome variability under identical commitments. Flake detection triggers quarantine unless:
the corridor explicitly permits stochastic outcomes with confidence semantics,
randomness is fully pinned and the variability is only in confidence intervals (not in raw outcomes).
D.4 Fractal — Module sealing, incremental rebuilds, regression harness
D.4.1 Module sealing: manifest, seeds, and merkle closure
Definition D.15 (ModuleManifestNF). A module manifest commits to:
exports/imports,
closure rules (edge kinds included),
policy set (CorridorIDs),
SeedCommit (generator recipe),
index commits (extraction indices),
quarantine overlays applied.
Rule D.16 (Sealing prerequisites).
All imports are pinned (GlobalAddrNF or ExternalPin with digest).
Closure computation is deterministic and committed.
Merkle closure holds: all referenced artifacts exist and verify by digest.
Any open obligations are either forbidden (strict corridor) or explicitly included with evidence plans (NEAR/AMBIG module status).
D.4.2 Incremental rebuilds and preserved IDs
Rule D.17 (Preserve unchanged commits). During rebuild:
if CanonBytes(NF(obj)) is unchanged, then Digest(obj) must be unchanged,
therefore AtomCommit/EdgeID/SnapshotID remain stable.
Rule D.18 (Delta records). A delta record commits to:
BaseSnapshotID and NewSnapshotID,
added/removed atom commits and edge IDs,
migration edges and conflict packets,
replay harness changes and required re-seals.
D.4.3 Regression harness: runner matrix and conformance suites
Regression is defined as:
replaying a pinned suite of scripts on a pinned set of snapshots/modules under pinned KernelIDs,
verifying that all commitments match expected digests,
measuring any permitted drift under policy (typically none for strict corridors).
Rule D.19 (Cross-runner holonomy). If multiple runners are used (OS/CPU variations), regression must either:
prove CanonBytes and numeric modes are invariant across runners, or
restrict OK sealing to a single runner class and treat cross-runner results as NEAR/AMBIG with explicit drift ledgers.
D.4.4 Toolchain lifecycle: kernel upgrades and migration policy
Any change to:
CanonBytes,
NF rules,
hashing,
proof checker semantics,
numeric backends,constitutes a KernelID change. Kernel upgrades require:
harness migration certificates (showing preserved commitments), or
explicit MIGRATE edges and re-sealing, or
quarantine until resolved.

Appendix E — Worked End-to-End Case Studies
E.1 Square — Forge a seed constant via constraint system + cert
E.1.1 Objects
E.1.1.1 Zero presentation for (\varphi)
Define the golden-ratio constant as the unique root in ([1,2]) of the polynomial constraint[H(x):=x^2-x-1.]Construct the zero presentation[\mathcal Z_\varphi := (X,\ H,\ \mathbb V,\ {0},\ \mathrm{Dom},\ \mathrm{Meta})]with:
(X=\mathbb R),
(\mathbb V=\mathbb R),
(\mathrm{Dom}=\mathbb R) (no branch primitives),
(\mathrm{Meta}) includes corridor tolerances ((\varepsilon_{\mathrm{OK}},\varepsilon_{\mathrm{NEAR}})), solver template ID, and replay kernel IDs.
Define the isolation region[S:=[1,2].]
E.1.1.2 Residual and hardness objects
Define residual:[\mathrm{Res}(x):=|H(x)|.]Define derivative:[H'(x)=2x-1.]Define an order-1 hardness lower bound on (S):[\gamma := \inf_{x\in S} H'(x) = 1.]This lower bound is a quantitative nondegeneracy witness for uniqueness and perturbation stability in the isolation region.
E.1.1.3 Enclosure objects and rational interval arithmetic
Represent enclosures as rational intervals[I_k=[a_k,b_k]\subseteq S,\quad a_k,b_k\in \mathbb Q,]together with sign data (\mathrm{sgn}(H(a_k))), (\mathrm{sgn}(H(b_k))). Rational endpoints ensure replay-deterministic arithmetic and avoid platform float drift.
E.1.1.4 SeedNF object for (\varphi)
Define the seed normal form[\mathfrak s_\varphi := (\mathrm{SeedID},\ \mathrm{SeedNF},\ \mathrm{SeedHash})]where SeedNF includes:
PresentationNF for (\mathcal Z_\varphi) (typed AST for (H), residual definition),
Isolation region (S=[1,2]),
Solver recipe (bisection on rational endpoints),
Hardness data ((H',\gamma)),
ReplayPtr requirements (KernelID, ScheduleNF, InputsNF),
WitnessPtr requirements (existence/uniqueness/hardness certs),
Expansion recipe (generate approximations, alternate equivalent presentations via EQUIV edges if desired).
E.1.2 Calculus
E.1.2.1 Existence by sign change
Compute:[H(1) = -1 < 0,\qquad H(2) = 1 > 0.]By continuity of (H), there exists (x^\star\in(1,2)) such that (H(x^\star)=0). This is the existence witness in (S).
E.1.2.2 Uniqueness by monotonicity
On (S=[1,2]),[H'(x)=2x-1 \ge 1 > 0.]Therefore (H) is strictly increasing on (S), hence (H) crosses zero at most once. Combined with existence, the root is unique in (S). This is the isolation/uniqueness witness.
E.1.2.3 Hardened-zero stability bound (order-1)
Let (\tilde H = H+\delta H) be a perturbation. If (|\delta H|\infty) on (S) is sufficiently small, then strict monotonicity persists and the zero perturbs continuously. In particular, because (H'\ge \gamma=1) on (S), a first-order stability bound takes the corridor form:[|\tilde x^\star - x^\star| \le \frac{|\delta H|\infty}{\gamma}]on the admissible perturbation class, with all terms explicitly ledgered when used.
E.1.2.4 Enclosure correctness and numeric commitment
Bisection produces a decreasing interval sequence (I_k) with:
(H(a_k)\le 0\le H(b_k)),
(|I_k| = b_k-a_k = 2^{-k},(b_0-a_0)),
hence (|I_k|\to 0) and the unique root lies in every (I_k).The enclosure radius and termination index are committed into the replay transcript.
E.1.3 Algorithms
E.1.3.1 NormalizeToZeroNF (presentation canonicalization)
Parse (H(x)=x^2-x-1) into a typed AST (over (\mathbb R)).
Set target (\mathbb V_0={0}) and residual (\mathrm{Res}(x)=|H(x)|).
Declare domain (\mathrm{Dom}=\mathbb R), isolation region (S=[1,2]).
Emit PresentationNF and compute BodyHash.
E.1.3.2 BisectionForge (deterministic enclosure)
Initialize (a_0=1), (b_0=2).
For (k=0,1,\dots):
(m_k=(a_k+b_k)/2).
If (H(m_k)=0), return (I_{k+1}=[m_k,m_k]).
If (H(a_k),H(m_k)<0), set (a_{k+1}=a_k), (b_{k+1}=m_k); else (a_{k+1}=m_k), (b_{k+1}=b_k).
A concrete 12-step enclosure (rational endpoints) is:
[
I_{12}=\left[\frac{6627}{4096},\ \frac{1657}{1024}\right]
\left[1.617919921875,\ 1.6181640625\right],]with[H!\left(\frac{6627}{4096}\right)<0,\qquad H!\left(\frac{1657}{1024}\right)>0.]
Termination for a target width (\tau) is the least (k) such that (|I_k|\le \tau). Emit the enclosure (I_k) and the bound (|x^\star - \mathrm{mid}(I_k)|\le |I_k|/2).
E.1.3.3 HardenZero (derivative bound cert)
Compute the derivative lower bound on (S):[\gamma=\inf_{x\in[1,2]} (2x-1)=1.]Emit the HardenedZero record:[Z_{\mathrm{hard}} := (\mathcal Z_\varphi,\ S,\ I_k,\ \gamma,\ \mathrm{WitnessPtr}).]
E.1.3.4 ForgeSeed (seal the constant as a proof-carrying seed)
Assemble SeedNF:
PresentationNF ((H), residual),
Region (S),
Solver recipe (bisection),
Hardened data ((H'), (\gamma)),
ReplayPtr manifest (KernelID, ScheduleNF, InputsNF containing (k), (a_0), (b_0)),
WitnessPtr manifest (existence/uniqueness/hardness certs).
Compute SeedID and store in CAS.
Emit REF edges from dependent theorems/algorithms to the seed atom.
Run regression replay to ensure stable SeedID under pinned toolchain.
E.1.4 Certificates
E.1.4.1 Existence cert (sign change)
Statement: (H(1)<0<H(2)\Rightarrow \exists x^\star\in(1,2):H(x^\star)=0).
Evidence: exact evaluation of (H(1)), (H(2)).
RegionNF: (S=[1,2]).
E.1.4.2 Uniqueness cert (monotonicity)
Statement: (H'(x)\ge 1) on (S\Rightarrow H) strictly increasing (\Rightarrow) unique root in (S).
Evidence: derivative bound on (S).
E.1.4.3 Enclosure cert (bisection)
Statement: root lies in the emitted rational interval (I_k) with certified width.
Evidence: replay transcript of bisection steps; sign invariants at endpoints.
E.1.4.4 Seed integrity cert (compression contract + replay closure)
Statement: Seed expands to reproduce (\mathcal Z_\varphi), (S), solver transcript, enclosure, and hardness bounds; compress(expand(seed)) returns identical SeedNF.
Evidence: ReplayPtr of Expand/Compress and hash commitments.
E.2 Flower — Certify an equivalence via commuting diagram + invariants
E.2.1 Objects
E.2.1.1 CP/CW/DP/DW corner objects and transforms
Fix the four-corner atlas:
CP: continuous particle representation,
CW: continuous wave/spectral representation,
DP: discrete particle samples,
DW: discrete wave coefficients.
Define transforms:
(B_C:\mathrm{CP}\to\mathrm{CW}) (continuous Fourier/eigen expansion),
(S_h:\mathrm{CP}\to\mathrm{DP}) (sampling/restriction),
(B_D:\mathrm{DP}\to\mathrm{DW}) (DFT/GFT),
(F_h:\mathrm{CW}\to\mathrm{DW}) (fold/unfold map; Nyquist corridor required).
E.2.1.2 The commuting square and defect metric
Define two paths from CP to DW:[p_1 := ( \mathrm{CP}\xrightarrow{S_h}\mathrm{DP}\xrightarrow{B_D}\mathrm{DW}),\qquadp_2 := (\mathrm{CP}\xrightarrow{B_C}\mathrm{CW}\xrightarrow{F_h}\mathrm{DW}).]Define the diagram defect on a corridor (S\subset\mathrm{CP}):[\Delta_{\square}(S) := \sup_{\psi\in S} \ \big| (B_D\circ S_h)(\psi) - (F_h\circ B_C)(\psi)\big|_{\mathrm{DW}}.]
E.2.1.3 Invariant suite for the equivalence gate
Use a Flower invariant suite (\mathfrak I_{\mathrm{spec}}) containing:
Bandlimit invariant: (\psi) lies in the corridor (\mathcal P_{\le K}) (no alias).
Energy invariant: (|\psi|_2^2) matches (|B_C\psi|_2^2) (Parseval under pinned normalization).
Discrete energy invariant: (|S_h\psi|_2^2) matches (|B_D S_h\psi|_2^2) (DFT/GFT unitarity in the discrete corridor).
Nyquist admissibility: (F_h) is injective on the declared band corridor.
E.2.1.4 Diagram witness object
A commuting-diagram witness is:[W_{\square}:=(p_1,\ p_2,\ S,\ \Delta_{\square}(S),\ \mathrm{MethodNF},\ \mathrm{ReplayPtr},\ \mathrm{WitnessPtr}).]For analytic corridors, (\mathrm{MethodNF}) may be a proof object; for numeric corridors, it is a replay script plus a test regime definition.
E.2.2 Calculus
E.2.2.1 Corridor definition (Nyquist / bandlimit)
Let (S) be the set of bandlimited signals:[S := {\psi:\ \mathrm{supp}(\widehat\psi)\subseteq[-K,K]},]with sample size (N) satisfying (N\ge 2K+1) under the pinned Fourier convention. This corridor makes (F_h) a well-defined injection (no alias overlap).
E.2.2.2 Exact commutation on the corridor
On (S), sampling followed by DFT recovers the same discrete coefficients as folding the continuous Fourier coefficients into the discrete lattice. Therefore:[(B_D\circ S_h)(\psi) = (F_h\circ B_C)(\psi)\quad \forall \psi\in S,]hence[\Delta_{\square}(S)=0.]
E.2.2.3 Obstruction outside the corridor (alias as noncommutation)
If (S) is enlarged to include frequencies beyond Nyquist, (F_h) is no longer injective: distinct (\psi) map to identical DW coefficients (structural kernel/quotient collapse). In that regime, exact commutation cannot hold for an injective interpretation, and the correct classification becomes:
FAIL for “perfect reconstruction/faithful equivalence” claims (Air no-go),
or NEAR/AMBIG for bounded “best approximation” claims with explicit alias ledger.
E.2.2.4 Equivalence edge semantics
The commuting diagram witness supports an EQUIV edge between the two derived DW presentations of the same underlying CP object on corridor (S):[\mathrm{EQUIV}(\mathrm{DW}{p_1}\sim \mathrm{DW}{p_2})\ \text{ gated by }\ \mathfrak I_{\mathrm{spec}}\ \text{ with }\ \Delta_{\square}(S)\le \varepsilon.]In the exact bandlimited corridor, (\varepsilon=0).
E.2.3 Algorithms
E.2.3.1 BuildCommutingDiagram
Normalize both paths to PathNF (adjacency discipline, gauge/branch pinning).
Validate admissibility of each edge on corridor (S).
Evaluate defect by analytic proof or deterministic test suite.
Emit DiagramWitnessNF and COMM-DIAG certificate.
E.2.3.2 Invariant gate filter (pre-check)
Before computing (\Delta_{\square}), verify:
bandlimit membership (projector residual (|(I-\mathcal P_{\le K})\psi|) is zero or bounded),
energy invariants (Parseval/DFT unitary checks),
Nyquist preconditions (sample size and fold admissibility).
If any gate fails, return FAIL (if certified) or AMBIG (if gates cannot be decided) with evidence plan to tighten corridor or increase observability.
E.2.3.3 Emit EQUIV edge + witness manifests
Emit:
an EQUIV LinkEdge whose payload includes TransformRefs for both paths, corridor (S), invariant suite (\mathfrak I_{\mathrm{spec}}), and defect bound,
WitnessPtr containing the diagram witness artifact and proof/test artifacts,
ReplayPtr for deterministic reproduction of the witness.
E.2.3.4 Holonomy audit (optional but canonical)
If alternative routes exist for either path (e.g., different factorization through adjacent lens swaps), enumerate a bounded loop family and compute holonomy residuals. Nonzero holonomy beyond tolerance blocks canonicalization under strict corridors.
E.2.4 Certificates
E.2.4.1 COMM-DIAG cert (exact corridor)
Statement: (\Delta_{\square}(S)=0).
Assumptions: bandlimit corridor and Nyquist admissibility.
Evidence: analytic proof or exhaustive deterministic test suite over a generating family (e.g., Fourier basis modes).
E.2.4.2 Spectral/energy invariance certs (gate suite)
Parseval invariance for (B_C) under pinned normalization.
Unitarity (or bounded defect) for (B_D) on discrete corridor.
E.2.4.3 Nyquist admissibility cert
Statement: fold/unfold map is injective on the declared band corridor.
Evidence: inequality constraints tying (K) and (N) plus explicit fold definition.
E.2.4.4 EQUIV witness sufficiency cert
Statement: witness set is sufficient to replay and verify commutation and gate conditions under the corridor.
Evidence: witness manifest hash and replay transcript hash.
E.3 Cloud — Propagate uncertainty through a rotation chain (NEAR→OK)
E.3.1 Objects
E.3.1.1 Noisy observation model on the CP→DP edge
Let (\psi\in \mathrm{CP}) be fixed (deterministic), and let sampling produce a noisy DP vector:[x := S_h(\psi) + \xi,]where (\xi) is a random noise vector with a pinned tail regime (e.g., sub-Gaussian with parameter (\sigma)) and pinned independence or dependence assumptions.
E.3.1.2 Rotation chain and target certificate
Consider a rotation chain (for example, the path (p_1) of E.2):[x \xrightarrow{B_D} \widehat x,]and a derived quantity (q(\widehat x)) (e.g., energy in a passband, a defect norm, or a commutation residual estimate). The goal is to certify:[q(\widehat x)\le \varepsilon_{\mathrm{OK}}]with confidence at least (1-\alpha), or to certify a bounded interval consistent with NEAR.
E.3.1.3 Uncertainty ledger objects
Define a Cloud ledger entry set:
tail regime certificate reference (TAIL-REG),
estimator definition (EST-RESID),
confidence bounds (CONC-BOUND),
propagation bounds through transforms (PROP-UNC),
identifiability flags (IDENT-CHECK when uniqueness is claimed).
E.3.1.4 Deterministic randomness policy for replay
If Monte Carlo estimation is used, pin RandPolicyNF:
PRNG algorithm ID,
seed commitment,
stream schedule (task label, draw index),so that sampled bounds are replay-deterministic at the transcript level.
E.3.2 Calculus
E.3.2.1 Pushforward and Lipschitz propagation
If (B_D) is unitary (or (L)-Lipschitz) on the corridor, noise propagates as:[|\widehat\xi| \le L,|\xi|\quad\text{where}\quad \widehat\xi := B_D(\xi).]Thus concentration bounds for (|\xi|) induce bounds for (|\widehat\xi|).
E.3.2.2 Concentration and confidence envelopes
For a sub-Gaussian noise model and a scalar functional (q(\widehat x)) that is (L_q)-Lipschitz in (\widehat x),[\mathbb P\big(|q(\widehat x)-\mathbb E q(\widehat x)|>\delta\big) \le 2\exp!\left(-\frac{\delta^2}{2L_q^2\sigma_q^2}\right),]with (\sigma_q) derived from the noise parameters and the transform chain constants. The corridor must pin the admissible bound family and all assumptions.
E.3.2.3 NEAR→OK upgrade condition (probabilistic corridor)
A probabilistic corridor promotes NEAR→OK when:
an upper confidence bound (q^{+}) satisfies (q^{+}\le \varepsilon_{\mathrm{OK}}),
the composed failure probability (\alpha_{\mathrm{total}}) is within corridor threshold (conservative union bound unless pinned otherwise),
all tail/mixing/identifiability assumptions required by the bound are certified.
E.3.2.4 Structural vs stochastic separation (abstention discipline)
If increasing sample budget reduces estimator variance but the residual plateau remains above tolerance, the remaining error is structural (alias, kernel collapse, twist/holonomy). In that case:
the correct outcome is FAIL (if obstruction is certified) or AMBIG with an evidence plan (if undecidable),
not OK, regardless of statistical confidence.
E.3.3 Algorithms
E.3.3.1 MonteCarlo defect estimation (deterministic replay)
Pin RandPolicyNF and sample budget schedule.
Generate (N) independent (or corridor-permitted dependent) noise realizations (\xi^{(i)}).
Compute (\widehat x^{(i)}=B_D(S_h(\psi)+\xi^{(i)})).
Compute (q_i=q(\widehat x^{(i)})).
Build a confidence bound (q^{+}) for (q) using the pinned estimator and concentration method.
Store all commitments (inputs, seeds, outputs) in TranscriptNF; emit CONC-BOUND certificate.
E.3.3.2 Propagate uncertainty through a chain (ledger automation)
Given a chain (T_n\circ\cdots\circ T_1), compute:
per-step Lipschitz bounds (L_i),
per-step estimation errors (\epsilon_i),and combine:[\mathrm{Err}{\mathrm{out}} \le \sum{i=1}^n \left(\prod_{j=i+1}^n L_j\right)\epsilon_i.]Emit PROP-UNC certificate and ledger entries for each term.
E.3.3.3 CandidateSet and EvidencePlan when bounds cannot close
If required tail or mixing assumptions are not certified:
emit AMBIG with CandidateSet over plausible tail regimes or dependence models,
emit EvidencePlan to obtain tail certificates, mixing diagnostics, or to switch to robust estimators.
E.3.3.4 NEAR→OK upgrade workflow
Re-run MonteCarlo defect estimation at increased sample budget or improved estimator class.
Update ledgers; recompute confidence envelope.
Promote to OK only when the corridor’s NEAR→OK predicate holds; otherwise remain NEAR/AMBIG.
E.3.4 Certificates
E.3.4.1 TAIL-REG cert
Pins the tail regime parameters and admissibility of the estimator family.
E.3.4.2 CONC-BOUND cert
Pins the confidence bound (q\le q^{+}) with failure probability (\alpha), including estimator definition, assumptions, and replay transcript.
E.3.4.3 PROP-UNC cert
Pins the end-to-end propagation inequality and all constants, with ledger completeness.
E.3.4.4 NEAR→OK upgrade cert
Pins:
the final bound (q^{+}\le \varepsilon_{\mathrm{OK}}),
composed (\alpha_{\mathrm{total}}) within threshold,
closure of all prerequisite assumptions and witness manifests.
E.4 Fractal — Full tunneling pipeline (refine → snap → route → seal)
E.4.1 Objects
E.4.1.1 Refined carrier and digit split
Fix refinement depth (d=3). Define:[M_d := 15\cdot 3^{d+4} = 15\cdot 3^7 = 32805,\qquad U_d:=\mathbb Z_{32805}.]Define divisor (D_d:=3^{d+4}=3^7=2187). Define digit split:[\sigma(u):=\left\lfloor \frac{u}{2187}\right\rfloor\in\mathbb Z_{15},\qquad q(u):=u\bmod 2187\in\mathbb Z_{2187}.]
E.4.1.2 Snap stride and snap step
Snap octave is (n=d=3). Snap stride:[s(d)=3^{d+5}=3^8=6561.]Snap step:[u_{t+1} = u_t + 6561\pmod{32805}.]
E.4.1.3 Route intent and route query
Define a route query to tunnel from one observed station to another while preserving fiber:
Start observation: ((\sigma_0,q_0)),
Target observation: ((\sigma_1,q_0)),
Intent: TUNNEL (a certified path that changes quotient while freezing fiber),
Corridor: snap corridor ((d=3,n=3)) with admissibility and invariants:
orbit length (5),
(\sigma\mapsto \sigma+3),
(q) invariant,
deterministic replay.
E.4.1.4 Sealable artifacts
Artifacts to be sealed:
Refinement atom: parameters ((d,M_d,D_d)) and decoders ((\sigma,q)).
Snap theorem instance: stride (s(d)) and certified 5-cycle behavior.
Route record: minimal-step route on (\sigma) and corresponding u-level route.
Module manifest: exports = route + certificates; imports = none (pure arithmetic) or pinned corridor policies.
E.4.2 Calculus
E.4.2.1 Snap invariants (5-cycle and frozen remainder)
Because (32805 = 5\cdot 6561), the u-step has orbit length (5):[u_5 = u_0 + 5\cdot 6561 \equiv u_0 \pmod{32805}.]Because (6561=3\cdot 2187), the remainder is invariant:[q(u_{t+1}) = (u_t+6561)\bmod 2187 = u_t\bmod 2187 = q(u_t).]The visible station increments by:[\sigma(u_{t+1}) \equiv \sigma(u_t) + 3 \pmod{15}.]
E.4.2.2 Worked snap tunnel instance (explicit u, σ, q)
Choose fiber value (q_0=123) and start station (\sigma_0=1). Define[u_0 := 1\cdot 2187 + 123 = 2310.]Then the orbit is:[\begin{aligned}u_0&=2310,\u_1&=2310+6561=8871,\u_2&=15432,\u_3&=21993,\u_4&=28554,\u_5&\equiv 2310\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 32805).\end{aligned}]Decoded:[(\sigma,q):\ (1,123)\to(4,123)\to(7,123)\to(10,123)\to(13,123)\to(1,123).]This is a concrete refine→snap instance where quotient moves and fiber freezes.
E.4.2.3 Route correctness on the quotient
In (\mathbb Z_{15}), snap move is (\sigma\mapsto \sigma+3). Therefore, from (\sigma_0=1) to (\sigma_1=7), the minimal route is 2 steps:[1\to 4\to 7.]The u-level route is therefore 2 applications of the snap step, and the fiber invariance guarantees the target has the same (q_0).
E.4.2.4 Sealability conditions (Fractal corridor)
A tunneling route is sealable only if:
refinement definitions are in NF and hashed,
snap invariants are certified (orbit length, fiber freeze, σ increment),
route compilation is deterministic and minimal under tie-breaks,
all artifacts are merkle-closed and replay-verified,
no-go triggers are absent (no undefined branch operations; no alias claims beyond corridor).
E.4.3 Algorithms
E.4.3.1 Refine (construct the refined carrier and decoders)
Emit AtomNF for ((d,M_d,D_d)).
Emit AtomNF for decoders (\sigma(u)=\lfloor u/D_d\rfloor) and (q(u)=u\bmod D_d).
Emit certificates: decoder correctness and reconstruction (u=\sigma D_d+q) for canonical representatives.
E.4.3.2 Snap (compute and certify the 5-cycle)
Compute stride (s=3^{d+5}).
Compute orbit (u_t=u_0+t s\pmod{M_d}) for (t=0..4).
Verify:
(u_5=u_0),
(q(u_t)=q(u_0)) for all (t),
(\sigma(u_{t+1})\equiv \sigma(u_t)+3\pmod{15}).
Store orbit record as CAS artifact and attach ReplayPtr.
E.4.3.3 Route (compile minimal tunnel path)
Solve quotient routing:
compute minimal (k\in{0,\dots,4}) such that (\sigma_0+3k\equiv \sigma_1\pmod{15}).
choose canonical (k) by minimal steps (ties impossible here).
Lift to u-route:
apply snap step (k) times to (u_0).
Emit RouteNF in PathNF:
edges = (k) copies of SnapStep,
region = ((d=3,n=3)),
invariants = fiber freeze and snap orbit constraints.
E.4.3.4 Seal (module sealing and regression)
Build witness set:
refinement correctness certs,
snap theorem instance certs,
route soundness cert,
replay determinism cert.
Create LinkEdges:
GEN edge producing orbit record from ((d,u_0)),
CERT edges for snap properties,
GEN/INST edge producing the route record from ((\sigma_0,\sigma_1,q_0)),
(optional) EQUIV edge linking quotient route and u-route as commuting diagram on observables.
Seal as ModuleManifestNF with exports:
the route record,
its certificates,
replay pointers.
Run regression harness:
recompute digests and verify stability of ModuleID and transcript hashes.
E.4.4 Certificates
E.4.4.1 Refinement coherence cert
Certifies:
(M_d=15\cdot 3^{d+4}),
decoder correctness for ((\sigma,q)),
reconstruction property (u=\sigma D_d+q) for canonical representatives.

Certifies for (d=3):
orbit length (5),
fiber freeze (q(u_{t+1})=q(u_t)),
station increment (\sigma\mapsto\sigma+3\pmod{15}),with replay transcript and minimal witness set.
E.4.4.3 Route soundness and minimality cert
Certifies:
the quotient route reaches (\sigma_1) from (\sigma_0) in minimal steps,
the lifted u-route reaches a state with the same fiber (q_0),
admissibility and invariant gates hold on the declared corridor.
E.4.4.4 Module integrity and replay closure cert
Certifies:
merkle closure of the module,
correctness of EdgeIDs and payload commitments,
deterministic replay of orbit and route generation,
regression stability of ModuleID under pinned toolchain.
