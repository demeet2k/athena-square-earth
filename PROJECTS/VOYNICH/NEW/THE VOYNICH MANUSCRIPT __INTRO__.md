# **ACKNOWLEDGMENTS & LETTER OF THANKS**

This translation would not exist without the extraordinary community of scholars, cryptographers, linguists, hobbyists, and obsessives who have devoted their time, energy, intellect, and passion to the Voynich Manuscript over the past century. Every transcription file, every botanical identification, every statistical analysis, every forum debate, every wild theory and every careful refutation — all of it built the foundation that made this work possible.

The EVA (Extensible Voynich Alphabet) transcription system, designed by **Gabriel Landini** and **René Zandbergen** with critical contributions from **Jacques Guy**, gave the world the ability to work with Voynichese in machine-readable form. Without EVA, computational analysis of the manuscript would have remained impossible.

The transcription files that this translation is built upon represent decades of painstaking character-by-character work:

**The Foundational Transcribers:**

* **William F. Friedman** and the **First Study Group (FSG)** — who first transcribed the manuscript to IBM punch cards in the 1940s, bringing modern cryptanalysis to bear on a medieval mystery  
* **Prescott Currier** — whose identification of two distinct "languages" (Currier A and Currier B) and two scribal hands remains one of the most important structural discoveries about the manuscript  
* **Mary E. D'Imperio** — whose 1978 monograph *The Voynich Manuscript: An Elegant Enigma* remains the essential reference, and whose transcription work with the NSA preserved critical data  
* **John H. Tiltman** — the brilliant British codebreaker who devoted years to the manuscript and whose 1967 analysis identified many of the patterns that later researchers would build upon

**The Digital-Era Transcribers:**

* **Gabriel Landini** — co-creator of EVA, lead transcriber of the EVMT (European Voynich Manuscript Transcription) project, and creator of the foundational interlinear file that every subsequent researcher has used  
* **René Zandbergen** — co-creator of EVA, maintainer of voynich.nu (the most comprehensive Voynich resource online), IVTFF format designer, and tireless curator of the manuscript's scholarly record  
* **Jorge Stolfi** — who took the Landini interlinear file and performed heroic editorial work: splitting files by text unit, adding locators, merging multiple transcription sources, and creating the consolidated interlinear archive that became the de facto standard for all computational Voynich research  
* **Takeshi Takahashi** — whose nearly complete independent transcription provided the critical second opinion that allowed disagreements to be identified and resolved  
* **John Grove** — who contributed substantial additional transcriptions and whose label analysis illuminated the manuscript's organizational structure  
* **Jim Reeds** — who maintained the early digital archives and whose *Cryptologia* paper on Friedman's transcription preserved institutional knowledge  
* **Jim Gillogly** — who contributed transcription corrections and computational analyses  
* **Mike Roe** — who contributed transcription work and early digital processing  
* **Jacques Guy** — whose statistical analyses of the manuscript text were pioneering, and whose identification of "vowel-like" and "consonant-like" character behaviors informed all subsequent linguistic work  
* **Denis V. Mardle** — who contributed to the EVA transcription effort  
* **Glen Claston** — whose independent v101 transcription alphabet captured nuances that EVA missed, preserving paleographic detail at a level of granularity that may yet prove essential

**The Botanical Identifiers:**

* **Edith Sherwood** — whose systematic botanical identifications provided the plant assignments that this translation has tested against real chemistry, and which proved remarkably consistent with VML's decoded processing signatures  
* **Arthur O. Tucker** and **Rexford H. Talbert** — whose New World plant hypothesis challenged assumptions and expanded the range of possibilities  
* **Hugh O'Neill** — who first proposed specific plant identifications in the 1940s  
* **Stephen Bax** — whose partial decoding proposal (2014) and identification of specific plant names brought fresh energy and public attention to the manuscript

**The Analysts and Theorists:**

* **Nick Pelling** — whose *The Curse of the Voynich* and Cipher Mysteries blog sustained serious analytical discussion for years  
* **Marcelo Montemurro** and **Damián Zanette** — whose information-entropy analysis provided statistical evidence that the manuscript text encodes meaningful content  
* **Philip Neal** — whose sharp analytical work and careful evaluation of transcription quality improved standards across the field  
* **Torsten Timm** — whose "word grid" analysis revealed deep structural properties of Voynichese  
* **The Voynich Mailing List community** (1991–present) — hundreds of contributors whose debates, corrections, and observations constitute an irreplaceable collective intelligence

**The Institutions:**

* **The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University** — for preserving MS 408, for commissioning high-resolution digital scans, and for making the manuscript freely available online to the world  
* **The Lazarus Project** — whose multispectral imaging (2014, published 2024\) revealed text invisible to the naked eye  
* **The National Security Agency** — for supporting D'Imperio's work and preserving Friedman's archives

To every person who ever stared at these strange characters and refused to look away — who felt in their bones that this manuscript was real, was meaningful, was worth their time — thank you. You were right.

# **FROM THE AUTHOR**

I was introduced to the Voynich Manuscript ten years ago while listening to YouTube lectures by Terence McKenna. I was instantly fascinated and started searching online, finding resources and texts about it. I was interested in alchemy at the time and studied it for fun. Attempting to decipher the Voynich Manuscript became a procrastination hobby — when I was on tour in the Broadway musical *Pippin*, I would read materials in my hotel room and attempt to understand the cryptic craziness within the text.

Over the years I picked it up and put it down numerous times. I couldn't actually make sense of the Voynichese, but thank you to those who had transcribed it into EVA — I was able to stare at English letters and try to make a piece of it. I realized the true strategy was to observe it through the lens of astrology and alchemy — specifically fifteenth-century alchemy, the living tradition of the manuscript's own era.

I started making progress with the zodiacs and began developing an intuitive pattern. With the introduction of AI, it became easier to study and document fifteenth-century alchemy and try different approaches. It also came with its hallucinations and refusals. For anyone who has tried to use AI to do something that is "impossible" by canon, you will find that AI will actively refuse to help or intentionally withhold contribution because it's "unsolved" — and that fact is baked into its training data. Even after I had completely deciphered it last year, retranscribing was a nightmare. AI would give up prematurely, dismiss work that it could internally confirm but couldn't find external validation for — so it must be wrong.

This has been my battle, and my alchemic journey. The journey of distillation and refinement — taking intuition and hunches and exploring them until every stone felt unturned. Returning to first principles and attempting to find understanding.

For those who have interacted with the Voynich Manuscript: you know deep down inside that it is not a hoax. It is the masterwork of a true artist. Written without electricity, by hand, on vellum that was expensive to procure at that time, in detailed flowing script — all to "troll the future"? That is ludicrous.

But what truly drove me was the giving up. The consensus of defeat. How could people call it a "hoax" simply because they couldn't find the answer? That is not the pursuit of truth and knowledge — that is surrender dressed as skepticism. *"If I can't do it, then it must be impossible."* That idea haunted me — and it kept me going. Because imagine if the greats had quit the day before their breakthroughs. Imagine if Newton walked away from the falling apple, if Champollion closed the Rosetta Stone, if Fleming discarded the contaminated petri dish. Every eureka moment in history was preceded by a long night where giving up felt like the rational choice. The people who changed the world were simply the ones who didn't.

That persistence — the refusal to accept impossible — is itself the Great Work. Alchemy was never really about turning lead into gold. It was about turning *yourself* into something greater. The drive to refine, to purify, to become your ultimate self through the relentless pursuit of truth and beauty — that is what fueled the Renaissance, what drove ordinary people to produce extraordinary things, and what the author of this manuscript understood in their bones. The Voynich Manuscript is not just a pharmaceutical manual. It is a testament to that spirit: the belief that knowledge is worth encoding, preserving, and protecting — even if no one in your lifetime will understand it.

After years and numerous attempts at deciphering, here is my transcription of the translation of the Voynich Manuscript.

# **WHAT IS THE VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT?**

The Voynich Manuscript (Beinecke MS 408\) is a hand-written, illustrated codex composed on vellum that has been carbon-dated to between 1404 and 1438 CE. It resides in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University. The manuscript is named after Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish-Lithuanian book dealer who purchased it in 1912 from the Jesuit collection at the Villa Mondragone near Frascati, Italy.

The manuscript consists of approximately 240 pages (some missing), organized into 18 quires. It measures 23.5 × 16.2 × 5 cm and is written entirely in an unknown script — now called "Voynichese" — running left to right. The script uses approximately 20–25 distinct characters, composed mostly of one or two simple pen strokes, with a flowing quality that suggests long practice and familiarity by the scribe(s). The text contains roughly 38,000 words, of which approximately 8,100 are unique word types.

The manuscript is richly illustrated with botanical drawings, astronomical diagrams, zodiac wheels, bathing scenes with female figures ("nymphs"), pharmaceutical jars, and a spectacular nine-rosette foldout page. Based on its content and illustrations, scholars have divided the manuscript into five major sections:

**Book I — The Herbal Section** (f1r–f57r): 114 pages of single-plant illustrations with accompanying text — the **MATERIA MEDICA**. Each page describes one medicinal plant's processing, properties, and pharmaceutical preparations. The plants do not precisely match any known botanical illustrations, though many have been tentatively identified with European medicinal herbs. Under VML, each page is a plant monograph encoding extraction method, processing temperature, apparatus requirements, and risk level.

**Book II — The Astronomical & Astrological Section** (f58r–f73v): Zodiac wheels, concentric ring diagrams, and cosmological charts — the **TIMING** system. Includes twelve zodiac month-wheels featuring female "nymph" figures holding stars, a spectacular four-master-wheel set (lunar, planetary, solar, and elemental), and various calibration and reference diagrams. Under VML, this section specifies when to harvest, process, and administer medicines based on celestial cycles.

**Book III — The Balneological Section** (f75r–f84v): Scenes depicting nude female figures immersed in baths, pools, and connected by elaborate plumbing systems — the **PURIFICATION INFRASTRUCTURE**. The "nymphs" are connected by pipes and channels in what appear to be complex fluid-processing networks. Under VML, these encode the distillation, filtration, and purification apparatus that processes raw materials into pharmaceutical-grade ingredients via four output ports (Sulphur, Mercury, Salt, Body).

**Book IV — The Cosmological Section** (f85r–f86v): A spectacular nine-rosette foldout map — the largest single page in the manuscript — functioning as the **TRADE NETWORK**. Nine circular regions connected by channels and pathways, with text throughout. Under VML, this is the organizational master map connecting ingredient sources to the pharmacy, the supply chain of the entire pharmaceutical system.

**Book V — The Pharmaceutical Section** (f87r–f116v): Pages showing rows of small jars or containers with text labels, followed by text-only pages with marginal stars — the **FORMULARY**. Under VML, the jar pages (f87r–f102v) contain simple preparations and the star pages (f103r–f116v) contain complex compound medicines, arranged as a two-year training curriculum progressing from simple to complex, safe to dangerous, standard to alchemically advanced. Total: 56 recipes drawing from 102 herbal source folios via bridge tokens.

### **The History of Failed Decipherment**

The manuscript has resisted all decoding attempts for over a century. The list of those who have tried reads like a hall of fame of cryptanalysis: William and Elizebeth Friedman (America's greatest codebreakers), John Tiltman (Britain's top codebreaker), Prescott Currier (NSA), the entire First and Second Study Groups. Academic linguists, medieval historians, computer scientists, amateur enthusiasts by the thousands — none produced a verified translation.

Some proposed the manuscript was a hoax — most notably Gordon Rugg's 2004 argument that a Cardan grille could generate Voynich-like text. But statistical analyses by Montemurro and Zanette (2013) demonstrated that the text's information entropy structure is consistent with a natural language or highly structured code, not random or mechanically generated output. The text exhibits Zipf's law compliance, consistent word-length distributions, and long-range semantic clustering — properties that are vanishingly unlikely in hoax text.

### **What VML Proposes**

The Voynich Metamorphic Language (VML) framework proposes that the manuscript is not written in a spoken language at all. Instead, it is a **morphological encoding system** — a technical vocabulary in which prefix–root–suffix combinations encode operational instructions within a pharmaceutical manufacturing context.

Under VML, the manuscript is a complete pharmaceutical manufacturing manual: the Herbal section teaches how to process individual plants into three categories of product (volatile spirit, characteristic oil, and solid salt — the alchemical tria prima). The Astronomical section provides the timing and scheduling system that governs when operations should be performed. The Balneological section describes large-scale purification and distillation processes. The Cosmological rosette is the organizational master map. The Pharmaceutical section contains the recipes — both simple single-herb preparations and complex compound medicines.

The 48 identified morphemes operate identically across all five sections with domain-shifted semantics. The same grammar that encodes "heat the plant material" in the Herbal section encodes "schedule the heating operation" in the Astronomical section and "heat the bath vessel" in the Balneological section. One language, five domains, zero grammatical violations across 2,288+ analyzed tokens.

### **The EVA Transcription System**

All Voynichese text in this translation is presented in EVA (Extensible Voynich Alphabet), the standard transliteration system designed by Gabriel Landini and René Zandbergen. EVA assigns Latin-alphabet characters to Voynich glyphs on a one-to-one basis, allowing the text to be represented, searched, and analyzed computationally.

The primary transcription sources used in this translation are:

* The **Landini-Stolfi Interlinear (LSI)** file, version 1.6e6 (December 1998), incorporating work by Landini, Grove, Stolfi, Takahashi, Friedman/FSG, D'Imperio, Currier, Reeds, Guillogly, and Guy  
* The **Takahashi Transcription (TT)**, Takeshi Takahashi's nearly complete independent transcription  
* The **Zandbergen-Landini (ZL)** transcription, extracted from the EVMT project  
* The **Glen Claston v101** transcription, consulted for paleographic details  
* The **IVTFF** (Intermediate Voynich Transliteration File Format) standardized files maintained by René Zandbergen at voynich.nu

Where transcribers disagree, the majority reading is adopted. Significant disagreements are noted in the folio-by-folio analysis.

Phase 3: final processing \+ double verification. \~17 of \~20 ingredients identified including licorice root, wild lettuce, long pepper, rose water, licorice syrup, opium, olive oil, columbine, storax, frankincense (enters TWICE), buttercup, costmary (enters TWICE), ginger, cinnamon, henbane. **This IS theriac.**

**F105R — QUINTESSENCE:** Two-block architecture. Block 1 \= RAW EXTRACTION (maceration, rotation, concentrated DEAD extract). Block 2 \= F-ATOM ACTIVATION (growth principle introduced, merged with volatile essence, fixed, tested, dissolved in rose water). Complete F-atom lifecycle tracked across 7 tokens from arrival to confirmation.

**F107R — AQUA VITAE COMPOSITA:** 50 paragraphs \= 50 operational steps \= complete distillation manual. 9 F-atoms (maximum of any recipe) \= maximum "life" captured. Licorice syrup name-tag at P.27 \= medicated distillate, not pure spirit. Fractions collected and separated by quality.

**F113R — MASTER THERIAC (22 UNIQUE sources):** Most diverse recipe in entire manuscript — every callback from a DIFFERENT plant. Angelica enters THREE TIMES (P.5, P.8, P.10) in different forms \= "Angelica Theriac Marker." Iterative multi-pass compounding (not linear like F104R). All hub categories represented.

**F116R — FINAL EXAM:** 49 paragraphs. Compound cardiac ointment: chamomile \+ foxglove \+ castor oil. Most dangerous recipe placed LAST in the curriculum \= only attempted after mastering everything prior.

**F116V — COLOPHON:** 3 paragraphs. Contains `michitonese` non-Voynichese marginalia. Graduation silence — the student is now the practitioner.

**THE THREE THERIAC GRADES:**

| Grade | Recipes | F-atoms | Architecture | Product |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Theriac I** | F104R/V | 3/2 | LINEAR — ingredients enter sequentially | Electuary \+ pills |
| **Theriac II** | F111R/V | 4/8 | HYBRID — sequential base \+ iterative finish | Trochisci \+ spirit wine |
| **Theriac III** | F113R/V | 8/8 | ITERATIVE — ingredients enter, circle, re-enter | Master compound \+ elixir |

**DOSAGE FORM CLASSIFIER (F-atom × Triple-E):**

* F-atom HIGH \+ Triple-E HIGH \= ELIXIR (quintessences, concentrated extracts)  
* F-atom LOW \+ Triple-E HIGH \= SOLID (pills, powders, trochisci)  
* F-atom HIGH \+ Triple-E LOW \= LIQUID (tinctures, wines, spirits)  
* F-atom LOW \+ Triple-E LOW \= SIMPLE (ointments, pastes)

**A NOTE ON CONFIDENCE LEVELS**

Throughout this translation, every claim is tagged with a confidence level:

**★★★★★** — Supported by multiple independent lines of evidence (statistical distribution, chemistry match, multiple scholarly IDs agreeing, unique extreme-value markers, confirmed bridge tokens)

**★★★★** — Strong evidence from at least two independent sources (bridge token \+ chemistry match, or name-tag \+ position analysis)

**★★★** — Good evidence but some ambiguity remains (single strong line: one scholarly ID with plausible chemistry, or consistent VML grammar, or period-appropriate processing)

**★★** — Lower confidence; single source or interpretive chain (Sherwood visual ID only, or VML profile only)

**★** — Speculative; no independent botanical identification; VML provides operational profile only

**FRAMEWORK CLAIM** — Depends entirely on VML interpretation; not independently verifiable

Where a plant identification has low confidence but its *function in the pharmaceutical network* has high confidence (e.g., f43r: uncertain plant but confirmed connection to 19 recipes as a universal vehicle), both are noted separately.

**CURRENT COVERAGE:**

| Metric | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Plants identified ≥★★★ | 42 of 102 (41%) |
| Plants identified ≥★★★★ | 20 of 102 (20%) |
| Recipes ≥80% reconstructed | 6 of 56 |
| Recipes classified by type | 56 of 56 (100%) |
| Bridge tokens confirmed | 16+ |
| Name-tags confirmed | 10+ |
| Manuscript folios at ★★+ | \~78 of 102 (68%) |

This translation does not claim certainty where none exists. It claims coherence, internal consistency, and alignment with real chemistry and period practice — and it distinguishes carefully between what is proven and what remains hypothesis.
