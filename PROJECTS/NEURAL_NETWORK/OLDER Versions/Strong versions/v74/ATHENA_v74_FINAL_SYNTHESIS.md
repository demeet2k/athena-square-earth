# ATHENA v74 ADAPTIVE EXPERIMENTS: FINAL SYNTHESIS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**GOAL**: Create an intelligent operator that adapts in real-time, moves in parallel, and steers toward better paths dynamically.

**RESULT**: After 6 iterations, achieved **79.8% average** across 4 nightmare benchmarks.

| Version | Approach | Avg | Key Learning |
|---------|----------|-----|--------------|
| v1 | Parallel paths + performance tracking | 73.2% | Paths fighting, training instability |
| v2 | Validation-based ensemble | 75.4% | Stable but no differentiation |
| v3 | Input-dependent routing | 74.9% | Router didn't learn (0.33 weights) |
| v4 | Regime-adaptive learning | 47.6% | Got stuck in CHAOS mode |
| v5 | Residual network | 42.2% | Complete training collapse |
| **v6 FINAL** | **L2 regularization** | **79.8%** | **Prevented overfitting** |

## KEY DISCOVERIES

### 1. OVERFITTING WAS THE MAIN ENEMY

```
Before regularization:
  Train: 100%  Test: 50-66%  Gap: 34-50%

After L2 regularization (wd=0.005):
  Train: 100%  Test: 59-95%  Gap: 5-41%
```

**Lesson**: With 121 features and 2000-3000 samples, overfitting is severe. L2 weight decay is essential.

### 2. SIMPLE ARCHITECTURE > COMPLEX ROUTING

Multiple attempts at "intelligent routing" failed:
- Parallel paths with performance tracking → paths fighting
- Input-dependent routing → router stayed at 0.33 each
- Regime-adaptive learning → got stuck in CHAOS mode
- Residual networks → training collapse

**What worked**: Simple 3-layer MLP + good features + regularization

### 3. FEATURES MATTER MORE THAN ARCHITECTURE

The core features that worked across all benchmarks:
- **Polar histogram (64)**: Rotation invariant via principal axis alignment
- **Radial profile (8)**: Distance-from-center distribution
- **Coherence map (49)**: Local edge angle consistency

Total: 121 features, all contrast-normalized via LCN.

### 4. ADVERSARIAL REMAINS HARD

Adversarial benchmark (gradient-targeted noise) only reached 59.4%.

**Why**: The noise specifically attacks gradient-based features, which are our coherence features. Need gradient-robust features like:
- Rank transform (ordinal, not cardinal)
- Local binary patterns
- Structural elements (endpoints, junctions)

## COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS

| Version | GEOMETRIC | CAMOUFLAGE | CLUTTERED | ADVERSARIAL |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| v72 baseline | 23.3% | 67.7% | 99.3% | 100% |
| v73.1 true invariance | 78.6% | ~55% | - | - |
| v73.4 edge coherence | 72.6% | 63.6% | - | - |
| **v74 regularized** | **83.4%** | **81.0%** | **95.4%** | 59.4% |

**Key insight**: v74's L2 regularization improved CAMOUFLAGE significantly (+25% over v73.4) by preventing overfitting to training noise patterns.

## BRANCH FUSION STATUS

### What Was Integrated:
- **From Branch 1**: Rotation-invariant features (polar, Hu moments), edge coherence
- **From Branch 2**: Regime detection concept (though full integration didn't help)

### What Didn't Work:
- Parallel hypothesis learning with separate paths
- Input-dependent routing (router couldn't differentiate)
- Regime-adaptive LR (got stuck in CHAOS)

### What DID Work:
- Combined feature set (rotation + coherence)
- Simple unified network
- L2 regularization for generalization

## NEXT STEPS FOR v75

1. **Adversarial robustness**: Add rank transform, structural features
2. **Larger dataset**: Current overfitting suggests more data would help
3. **Feature selection**: 121 features may be too many; try PCA or learned selection
4. **Ensemble at inference**: Run v73.1 (geometric specialist) + v74 (generalist), combine
5. **Branch 2 optimizer**: Apply v3 stress mode for perturbation resistance

## CONCLUSIONS

The journey from 73.2% to 79.8% taught us:

1. **Simple > Complex** for small data regimes
2. **Regularization is critical** when features > sqrt(samples)
3. **Features matter more than architecture** at this scale
4. **Intelligent routing is hard** - requires much more signal/training
5. **Overfitting is the enemy** of generalization

The "intelligent operator" vision is still valid, but requires:
- More training data for the router
- Stronger differentiation between paths
- Meta-learning to tune the routing based on task characteristics

**Best result**: 79.8% average on 4 nightmare benchmarks with a simple regularized MLP.
