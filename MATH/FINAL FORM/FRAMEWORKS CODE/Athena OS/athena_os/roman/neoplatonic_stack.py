ATHENA OS - ROMAN KERNEL: NEOPLATONIC STACK MODULE
===================================================
Multi-Level Ontology and Spiritual Ascent Algorithm

THE NEOPLATONIC STACK:
    A multi-level ontology that interprets reality as a stack of
    "virtual machines" (One → Intellect → Soul → Nature) and
    provides an ascent algorithm for returning to higher levels.

EMANATION HIERARCHY (Plotinus):
    
    THE ONE (τὸ ἕν)
    │   - Absolute unity, beyond being and thought
    │   - Source of all, but itself ineffable
    │   - Analogous to: Root process, ground of computation
    │
    ▼ (Emanation)
    NOUS (νοῦς) - INTELLECT
    │   - First emanation, contains all Forms/Ideas
    │   - Being and Thinking are identical here
    │   - Analogous to: Type system, Forms as types
    │
    ▼ (Emanation)
    PSYCHE (ψυχή) - SOUL
    │   - World Soul and individual souls
    │   - Mediates between intelligible and sensible
    │   - Analogous to: Runtime environment
    │
    ▼ (Emanation)
    PHYSIS (φύσις) - NATURE/MATTER
        - Lowest level, associated with multiplicity
        - Physical world, subject to change and decay
        - Analogous to: Hardware layer, I/O

ASCENT ALGORITHM (epistrophē):
    1. Purification: Remove attachment to lower levels
    2. Contemplation: Turn attention toward higher levels
    3. Unification: Achieve identity with Nous
    4. Henosis: Union with The One (rare, mystical)

TYPE SYSTEM:
    - Forms in Nous are types
    - Instances in Soul/Nature must be typed by Forms
    - Type-checking: Does sensible match intelligible pattern?

SOURCES:
    - Plotinus: Enneads
    - Porphyry: Life of Plotinus
    - Proclus: Elements of Theology
    - Cicero: Platonic works (Dream of Scipio)
