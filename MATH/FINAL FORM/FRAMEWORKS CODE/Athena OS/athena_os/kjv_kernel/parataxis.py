ATHENA OS - KJV BIBLE COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK
==============================================
Part VII: Parataxis System (The "And" Operator)

PARATAXIS VS HYPOTAXIS:
    - PARATAXIS: Clauses linked by "and" (coordinate structure)
    - HYPOTAXIS: Clauses linked by subordinating conjunctions
    
    The KJV preserves the paratactic structure of Hebrew (waw-consecutive)
    creating a chain of LOGICAL OPERATIONS.

THE "AND" OPERATOR:
    The Hebrew "waw" (ו) is consistently rendered as "And" in KJV.
    This creates a visible LOGIC CHAIN in the English text.
    
    Genesis 1:1-5 contains 7 "And" operators, forming a complete
    creation subroutine.

THE PARATACTIC CHAIN:
    Each "And" functions as a SEQUENCE OPERATOR:
    - Links cause to effect
    - Creates temporal ordering
    - Establishes logical dependencies
    
    "And God said... And it was so... And God saw..." forms an
    execution loop: COMMAND → EXECUTE → VERIFY
