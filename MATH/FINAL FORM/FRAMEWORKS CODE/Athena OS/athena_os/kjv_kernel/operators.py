Part VI: The Operators (Shall/Will, Thee/Ye, Italics)

THE SHALL OPERATOR (Predictive/Assertive):
    - SHALL: Certitude, inevitability, divine decree (first person)
    - WILL: Intention, desire, volition (second/third person)
    
    "Shall" transforms promises into EXECUTABLES waiting for
    the runtime clock to reach the specific tick.

THE THEE/YE PROTOCOL (Static Variable Typing):
    - THOU/THEE: Singular second person (one individual)
    - YE/YOU: Plural second person (group/audience)
    
    The KJV uses consistent, differentiated address forms.

THE ITALICS PROTOCOL (System Wrappers):
    Italicized words indicate INTERPOLATION - words inserted
    for English grammar that are absent from the source text.
    
    They are tagged as INTERFACE VARIABLES - structural supports
    required for grammatical stability, but absent from the
    ontological reality of the Source Code.
