## Chapter 1: Topological and Geometric Preliminaries

### 1.1 Smooth Manifolds and Coordinate Charts

**Definition 1.1.1 (Topological Manifold).** A *topological manifold* of dimension n is a second-countable Hausdorff topological space M such that every point p ∈ M has a neighborhood U ⊂ M homeomorphic to an open subset of ℝⁿ.

**Definition 1.1.2 (Chart).** A *chart* on M is a pair (U, φ) where U ⊂ M is open and φ : U → φ(U) ⊂ ℝⁿ is a homeomorphism onto an open subset of ℝⁿ. The coordinate functions are xⁱ = πⁱ ∘ φ where πⁱ : ℝⁿ → ℝ is projection onto the i-th component.

**Definition 1.1.3 (Atlas and Smooth Structure).** A collection of charts {(Uα, φα)} whose domains cover M is called an *atlas*. Two charts (U, φ) and (V, ψ) are *C∞-compatible* if the transition map

ψ ∘ φ⁻¹ : φ(U ∩ V) → ψ(U ∩ V)

is a C∞ diffeomorphism. A *smooth structure* on M is a maximal atlas of pairwise C∞-compatible charts. A *smooth manifold* is a topological manifold equipped with a smooth structure.

**Definition 1.1.4 (Riemannian Metric).** A *Riemannian metric* g on a smooth manifold M is a smooth assignment p ↦ gₚ of an inner product gₚ on each tangent space TₚM. In local coordinates (x¹, ..., xⁿ), the metric is represented by the positive-definite symmetric matrix

gᵢⱼ(x) = g(∂/∂xⁱ, ∂/∂xʲ).

The pair (M, g) is called a *Riemannian manifold*.

**Definition 1.1.5 (Riemannian Volume Form).** On an oriented Riemannian manifold (M, g) of dimension n, the *Riemannian volume form* is

dvol_g = √(det(gᵢⱼ)) dx¹ ∧ ... ∧ dxⁿ

in local coordinates. This induces a positive measure on M, also denoted dvol_g.

### 1.2 Function Spaces on Domains and Manifolds

#### 1.2.1 Lebesgue Spaces

**Definition 1.2.1 (Lᵖ Spaces).** Let (X, μ) be a measure space. For 1 ≤ p < ∞, define

Lᵖ(X, μ) = {f : X → ℝ measurable | ∫_X |f(x)|ᵖ dμ(x) < ∞}

with norm ‖f‖_{Lᵖ} = (∫_X |f(x)|ᵖ dμ)^{1/p}. For p = ∞,

L^∞(X, μ) = {f : X → ℝ measurable | ess sup_{x∈X} |f(x)| < ∞}

with ‖f‖_{L^∞} = ess sup |f|.

**Theorem 1.2.2 (Completeness).** For 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, (Lᵖ(X, μ), ‖·‖_{Lᵖ}) is a Banach space. Moreover, L²(X, μ) is a Hilbert space with inner product

⟨f, g⟩_{L²} = ∫_X f(x) g(x) dμ(x).

#### 1.2.2 Sobolev Spaces

**Definition 1.2.3 (Weak Derivative).** Let Ω ⊂ ℝⁿ be open. A function u ∈ L¹_loc(Ω) has *weak partial derivative* ∂ᵅu ∈ L¹_loc(Ω) for multi-index α if

∫_Ω u(x) ∂ᵅφ(x) dx = (-1)^{|α|} ∫_Ω (∂ᵅu)(x) φ(x) dx,  ∀φ ∈ C_c^∞(Ω).

**Definition 1.2.4 (Sobolev Spaces W^{k,p}).** For k ∈ ℕ and 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, define

W^{k,p}(Ω) = {u ∈ Lᵖ(Ω) | ∂ᵅu ∈ Lᵖ(Ω) for all |α| ≤ k}

with norm

‖u‖_{W^{k,p}} = (∑_{|α|≤k} ‖∂ᵅu‖_{Lᵖ}^p)^{1/p}  for p < ∞,
‖u‖_{W^{k,∞}} = max_{|α|≤k} ‖∂ᵅu‖_{L^∞}.

We write H^k(Ω) = W^{k,2}(Ω), which is a Hilbert space.

**Definition 1.2.5 (H¹₀(Ω)).** Define H¹₀(Ω) as the closure of C_c^∞(Ω) in the H¹(Ω) norm. This space consists of H¹ functions that "vanish on the boundary" in the trace sense.

**Definition 1.2.6 (Sobolev Spaces on Manifolds).** Let (M, g) be a compact Riemannian manifold. For s ∈ ℝ, if {φₖ}_{k=0}^∞ is an orthonormal basis of L²(M) consisting of eigenfunctions of -Δ_g with eigenvalues {λₖ}, define

H^s(M) = {u = ∑_{k=0}^∞ uₖ φₖ | ∑_{k=0}^∞ (1+λₖ)^s |uₖ|² < ∞}

with norm ‖u‖_{H^s(M)}² = ∑_{k=0}^∞ (1+λₖ)^s |uₖ|².

### 1.3 Boundary Conditions and Trace Operators

**Definition 1.3.1 (Lipschitz Domain).** A bounded domain Ω ⊂ ℝⁿ has *Lipschitz boundary* if ∂Ω can locally be represented as the graph of a Lipschitz function.

**Theorem 1.3.2 (Trace Theorem).** Let Ω ⊂ ℝⁿ be bounded with Lipschitz boundary. There exists a unique bounded linear operator

γ : H¹(Ω) → H^{1/2}(∂Ω)

such that γ(u) = u|_{∂Ω} for all u ∈ H¹(Ω) ∩ C(Ω̄). Moreover:
1. γ is surjective onto H^{1/2}(∂Ω).
2. ker(γ) = H¹₀(Ω).

**Definition 1.3.3 (Dirichlet Boundary Condition).** A function u ∈ H¹(Ω) satisfies *homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions* if u ∈ H¹₀(Ω), i.e., γ(u) = 0 on ∂Ω.

**Definition 1.3.4 (Neumann Boundary Condition).** Let Ω have C¹ boundary with outward unit normal ν. For u ∈ H²(Ω), the *Neumann boundary condition* is

∂u/∂ν = ∇u · ν = h  on ∂Ω

for given h. The homogeneous case is h ≡ 0.

**Definition 1.3.5 (Robin Boundary Condition).** The *Robin boundary condition* is

α(x) u(x) + β(x) ∂u/∂ν(x) = g(x)  on ∂Ω

for given functions α, β, g with α, β ≥ 0.

**Definition 1.3.6 (Periodic Boundary Conditions).** On the n-torus 𝕋ⁿ = ℝⁿ/(2π ℤⁿ), a function is *periodic* if it respects the quotient structure. Equivalently, on a rectangular domain Ω = (0, L₁) × ··· × (0, Lₙ), periodic conditions require

u(..., 0, ...) = u(..., Lⱼ, ...),   ∂u/∂xⱼ(..., 0, ...) = ∂u/∂xⱼ(..., Lⱼ, ...)

for each coordinate direction j.

## Chapter 2: Differential Operators on Continuous Spaces

### 2.1 Linear Differential Operators

**Definition 2.1.1 (Linear Differential Operator).** A *linear differential operator* of order m on Ω ⊂ ℝⁿ is an expression

L = ∑_{|α|≤m} aᵅ(x) ∂ᵅ

where aᵅ : Ω → ℝ (or ℂ) are coefficient functions and ∂ᵅ = ∂^{α₁}_{x₁} ··· ∂^{αₙ}_{xₙ}.

**Definition 2.1.2 (Principal Symbol).** The *principal symbol* of L is

σₘ(L)(x, ξ) = ∑_{|α|=m} aᵅ(x) ξᵅ,   ξ ∈ ℝⁿ.

This is a homogeneous polynomial of degree m in ξ.

**Definition 2.1.3 (Ellipticity).** L is *elliptic* at x ∈ Ω if σₘ(L)(x, ξ) ≠ 0 for all ξ ∈ ℝⁿ \ {0}. For second-order operators with principal part

L₂ = ∑_{i,j=1}^n aⁱʲ(x) ∂²_{xᵢxⱼ},

ellipticity means the coefficient matrix A(x) = (aⁱʲ(x)) is positive or negative definite. L is *uniformly elliptic* if there exist 0 < λ ≤ Λ < ∞ such that

λ |ξ|² ≤ ∑_{i,j} aⁱʲ(x) ξᵢξⱼ ≤ Λ |ξ|²,   ∀x ∈ Ω, ∀ξ ∈ ℝⁿ.

---

### 2.2 The Laplace-Beltrami Operator

**Definition 2.2.1 (Gradient on Manifolds).** On a Riemannian manifold (M, g), the *gradient* of f ∈ C^∞(M) is the vector field ∇_g f defined by

g(∇_g f, X) = df(X) = X(f)

for all vector fields X. In local coordinates,

(∇_g f)ⁱ = gⁱʲ ∂f/∂xʲ.

**Definition 2.2.2 (Divergence on Manifolds).** The *divergence* of a vector field X on (M, g) is

div_g(X) = (1/√det g) ∂/∂xⁱ(√det g · Xⁱ).

**Definition 2.2.3 (Laplace-Beltrami Operator).** The *Laplace-Beltrami operator* on (M, g) is

Δ_g = div_g(∇_g) : C^∞(M) → C^∞(M).

In local coordinates,

Δ_g f = (1/√det g) ∂/∂xⁱ(gⁱʲ √det g · ∂f/∂xʲ).

On ℝⁿ with the Euclidean metric, this reduces to the standard Laplacian Δ = ∑ᵢ ∂²/∂xᵢ².

**Proposition 2.2.4 (Self-Adjointness).** For f, g ∈ C_c^∞(M), the Laplace-Beltrami operator satisfies

∫_M f · Δ_g(h) dvol_g = ∫_M Δ_g(f) · h dvol_g = -∫_M g(∇_g f, ∇_g h) dvol_g.

*Proof.* Apply divergence theorem: ∫_M div_g(f ∇_g h) dvol_g = 0 for compactly supported functions, then expand using the product rule div_g(f X) = f div_g(X) + g(∇_g f, X). □

**Definition 2.3.2 (Dirichlet Form).** On a domain Ω ⊂ ℝⁿ, the *Dirichlet form* is

a(u, v) = ∫_Ω ∇u · ∇v dx

with form domain V_D = H¹₀(Ω) (Dirichlet) or V_N = H¹(Ω) (Neumann).

**Theorem 2.3.3 (Form Representation Theorem).** Let a be a densely defined, symmetric, closed, bounded-below quadratic form on a Hilbert space H with form domain V. Then there exists a unique self-adjoint operator A : D(A) → H such that:
1. D(A) ⊂ V and D(A) is a core for V.
2. a(u, v) = ⟨Au, v⟩_H for all u ∈ D(A), v ∈ V.
3. A is bounded below with the same lower bound as a.

**Definition 2.3.4 (Dirichlet Laplacian).** The *Dirichlet Laplacian* A_D on Ω is the self-adjoint operator associated with the Dirichlet form on V_D = H¹₀(Ω). Explicitly,

D(A_D) = {u ∈ H¹₀(Ω) | ∃f ∈ L²(Ω) : ∫_Ω ∇u · ∇v dx = ∫_Ω f v dx, ∀v ∈ H¹₀(Ω)}

and A_D u = -Δu in the distribution sense. On smooth domains, D(A_D) = H²(Ω) ∩ H¹₀(Ω).

**Definition 2.3.5 (Neumann Laplacian).** The *Neumann Laplacian* A_N is the self-adjoint operator associated with the Dirichlet form on V_N = H¹(Ω). On smooth domains,

D(A_N) = {u ∈ H²(Ω) | ∂u/∂ν = 0 on ∂Ω}.

The kernel of A_N consists of constant functions.

### 2.4 Spectral Decomposition

**Theorem 2.4.1 (Spectral Theorem for Compact Resolvent).** Let A be a self-adjoint, nonnegative operator on a separable Hilbert space H with compact resolvent (A + I)⁻¹. Then:
1. The spectrum σ(A) is purely discrete: σ(A) = {λₖ}_{k=1}^∞ with 0 ≤ λ₁ ≤ λ₂ ≤ ··· → ∞.
2. Each eigenvalue has finite multiplicity.
3. There exists an orthonormal basis {φₖ}_{k=1}^∞ of H with Aφₖ = λₖφₖ.
4. For any f ∈ H, f = ∑_k ⟨f, φₖ⟩ φₖ with convergence in H.

**Theorem 2.4.2 (Spectral Decomposition of Laplacians).** Let Ω ⊂ ℝⁿ be bounded with Lipschitz boundary, or let M be a compact Riemannian manifold.

1. *Dirichlet case:* A_D = -Δ on H¹₀(Ω) has discrete spectrum
   0 < λ₁^D ≤ λ₂^D ≤ ··· → ∞
   with orthonormal eigenfunctions {φₖ^D} ⊂ H¹₀(Ω).

2. *Neumann case:* A_N = -Δ on H¹(Ω) has discrete spectrum
   0 = λ₀^N < λ₁^N ≤ λ₂^N ≤ ··· → ∞
   with φ₀^N = const and orthonormal eigenfunctions {φₖ^N} ⊂ H¹(Ω).

3. *Closed manifold:* -Δ_g on L²(M) has spectrum
   0 = λ₀ < λ₁ ≤ λ₂ ≤ ··· → ∞
   with orthonormal eigenfunctions {φₖ} ⊂ C^∞(M).

**Theorem 2.4.3 (Variational Characterization - Courant-Fischer).** The k-th eigenvalue admits the min-max characterization

λₖ = min_{dim S = k} max_{0 ≠ u ∈ S} R(u),   where R(u) = a(u,u)/‖u‖²_{L²}

is the Rayleigh quotient. Equivalently,

λₖ = min_{S ⊥ span{φ₁,...,φ_{k-1}}} max_{0 ≠ u ∈ S} R(u).

## Chapter 3: Evolution Operators and Semigroups

### 3.1 The Heat Semigroup

**Definition 3.1.1 (Heat Equation).** The *heat equation* on a domain Ω or manifold M is

∂u/∂t = Δu,   u(0, x) = u₀(x),

with appropriate boundary conditions if ∂Ω ≠ ∅.

**Theorem 3.1.2 (Heat Semigroup).** Let A = -Δ be the (Dirichlet or Neumann) Laplacian on L²(Ω) or L²(M). The operator

e^{tΔ} := e^{-tA} = ∑_{k=0}^∞ e^{-tλₖ} ⟨·, φₖ⟩ φₖ

defines a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on L²(Ω) with generator Δ. The solution to the heat equation with initial data u₀ is u(t) = e^{tΔ} u₀.

**Properties of the Heat Semigroup:**

1. *Contractivity:* ‖e^{tΔ} u₀‖_{L²} ≤ ‖u₀‖_{L²} for all t ≥ 0.

2. *Positivity preservation:* If u₀ ≥ 0, then e^{tΔ} u₀ ≥ 0.

3. *Mass conservation (Neumann/closed manifold):* ∫ e^{tΔ} u₀ = ∫ u₀.

4. *Smoothing:* e^{tΔ} : L²(Ω) → C^∞(Ω) for t > 0.

5. *Exponential decay to equilibrium:* For Dirichlet conditions,
   ‖e^{tΔ} u₀‖_{L²} ≤ e^{-λ₁ t} ‖u₀‖_{L²}.
   For Neumann/closed manifold,
   ‖e^{tΔ} u₀ - ⟨u₀, φ₀⟩ φ₀‖_{L²} ≤ e^{-λ₁ t} ‖u₀ - ⟨u₀, φ₀⟩ φ₀‖_{L²}.

**Definition 3.1.3 (Heat Kernel).** The *heat kernel* p_t(x, y) is the integral kernel of e^{tΔ}:

(e^{tΔ} u₀)(x) = ∫ p_t(x, y) u₀(y) dy.

In terms of the spectral decomposition, p_t(x, y) = ∑_k e^{-λₖ t} φₖ(x) φₖ(y).

**Definition 3.2.1 (Wave Equation).** The *wave equation* on Ω or M is

∂²u/∂t² = Δu,   u(0) = u₀,   ∂_t u(0) = v₀.

**Definition 3.2.2 (Wave Propagators).** Define the *cosine* and *sine* propagators:

cos(t√(-Δ)) u₀ = ∑_k cos(√λₖ t) ⟨u₀, φₖ⟩ φₖ

sin(t√(-Δ))/√(-Δ) v₀ = ∑_k (sin(√λₖ t)/√λₖ) ⟨v₀, φₖ⟩ φₖ.

The solution to the wave equation is

u(t) = cos(t√(-Δ)) u₀ + (sin(t√(-Δ))/√(-Δ)) v₀.

These are unitary groups on appropriate energy spaces.

**Definition 3.2.3 (Schrödinger Equation).** The *Schrödinger equation* with Hamiltonian H = -Δ + V is

i ∂u/∂t = Hu,   u(0) = u₀.

**Definition 3.2.4 (Schrödinger Propagator).** The solution operator is the unitary group

e^{-itH} = ∑_k e^{-itλₖ} ⟨·, φₖ⟩ φₖ

where {λₖ} are eigenvalues of H. The Schrödinger propagator preserves L² norms: ‖e^{-itH} u₀‖_{L²} = ‖u₀‖_{L²}.

### 4.1 Weak Solutions and Lax-Milgram

**Definition 4.1.1 (Weak Formulation).** A function u ∈ H¹₀(Ω) is a *weak solution* of the Dirichlet problem

-Δu = f in Ω,   u = 0 on ∂Ω

if

∫_Ω ∇u · ∇v dx = ∫_Ω f v dx,   ∀v ∈ H¹₀(Ω).

**Theorem 4.1.2 (Lax-Milgram).** Let V be a Hilbert space, a : V × V → ℝ a bounded, coercive bilinear form:
- |a(u, v)| ≤ M ‖u‖_V ‖v‖_V (bounded)
- a(u, u) ≥ α ‖u‖_V² for some α > 0 (coercive)

Then for every F ∈ V*, there exists a unique u ∈ V such that a(u, v) = F(v) for all v ∈ V.

*Proof Sketch.* By Riesz representation, define T : V → V by a(Tu, v) = ⟨u, v⟩_V. Coercivity and boundedness imply T is bounded with bounded inverse. Then u = T⁻¹(Riesz representative of F). □

**Theorem 4.1.3 (Existence and Uniqueness for Poisson).** For f ∈ H⁻¹(Ω) (dual of H¹₀), there exists a unique weak solution u ∈ H¹₀(Ω) to -Δu = f with

‖u‖_{H¹} ≤ C ‖f‖_{H⁻¹}.

---

### 4.2 Interior and Boundary Regularity

‖u‖_{H²(Ω')} ≤ C(‖f‖_{L²(Ω)} + ‖u‖_{H¹(Ω)}).

**Theorem 4.2.2 (Higher Interior Regularity).** If the coefficients are in C^{k,α} and f ∈ H^m_{loc}(Ω), then u ∈ H^{m+2}_{loc}(Ω). In particular, if f ∈ C^∞(Ω), then u ∈ C^∞(Ω).

**Theorem 4.2.3 (De Giorgi-Nash-Moser).** Let u ∈ H¹_{loc}(Ω) be a weak solution of -∇ · (A(x) ∇u) = 0 where A(x) is uniformly elliptic with bounded measurable entries. Then u is locally Hölder continuous: for each Ω' ⋐ Ω, there exist α ∈ (0, 1) and C > 0 such that

|u(x) - u(y)| ≤ C ‖u‖_{L²(Ω)} |x - y|^α,   ∀x, y ∈ Ω'.

**Theorem 4.2.4 (Global H² Regularity for Dirichlet).** Let Ω have C^{1,1} boundary and f ∈ L²(Ω). The weak solution u ∈ H¹₀(Ω) of -Δu = f satisfies u ∈ H²(Ω) and

‖u‖_{H²(Ω)} ≤ C ‖f‖_{L²(Ω)}.

**Theorem 4.2.5 (Schauder Estimates).** Let Ω have C^{2,α} boundary, coefficients in C^{0,α}(Ω̄), f ∈ C^{0,α}(Ω̄), and boundary data g ∈ C^{2,α}(∂Ω). Then the solution u to the Dirichlet problem satisfies u ∈ C^{2,α}(Ω̄) and

- E ⊂ {{i, j} : i, j ∈ V, i ≠ j} is the edge set
- w : V × V → [0, ∞) is a symmetric weight function with w_{ij} = w_{ji} ≥ 0 and w_{ij} > 0 ⟺ {i, j} ∈ E

### 5.3 Graph Laplacians

**Definition 5.3.1 (Combinatorial Graph Laplacian).** The *(combinatorial) graph Laplacian* is the matrix

L = D - A.

Equivalently, L acts on u : V → ℝ by

(Lu)_i = ∑_{j=1}^N w_{ij}(u_i - u_j) = d_i u_i - ∑_{j=1}^N w_{ij} u_j.

**Proposition 5.3.2 (Properties of L).** The combinatorial Laplacian satisfies:
1. L is symmetric: L = L^T.
2. L is positive semidefinite: ⟨Lu, u⟩ ≥ 0.
3. L has row sums zero: L𝟙 = 0 where 𝟙 = (1, ..., 1)^T.
4. ker(L) = span{𝟙} if and only if G is connected.

*Proof of (2) and (4).* Compute the quadratic form:

⟨Lu, u⟩ = ∑_i u_i (Lu)_i = ∑_i u_i ∑_j w_{ij}(u_i - u_j)
       = ∑_{i,j} w_{ij} u_i(u_i - u_j)
       = ½ ∑_{i,j} w_{ij}(u_i - u_j)² ≥ 0.

Equality holds iff u_i = u_j whenever w_{ij} > 0, which for connected graphs means u = const. □

**Definition 5.3.3 (Normalized Laplacians).** Define:

1. *Symmetric normalized Laplacian:*
   L_{sym} = D^{-1/2} L D^{-1/2} = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}.

2. *Random-walk Laplacian:*
   L_{rw} = D^{-1} L = I - D^{-1} A = I - P,
   where P = D^{-1} A is the transition matrix of simple random walk.

**Proposition 5.3.4 (Spectral Properties of Normalized Laplacians).**

1. L_{sym} and L_{rw} have the same eigenvalues.
2. If v is an eigenvector of L_{sym} with eigenvalue μ, then D^{1/2} v is an eigenvector of L_{rw}.
3. The eigenvalues satisfy 0 = μ₀ ≤ μ₁ ≤ ... ≤ μ_{N-1} ≤ 2.
4. μ_{N-1} = 2 iff G is bipartite.

### 5.4 Spectral Graph Theory

**Theorem 5.4.1 (Spectral Decomposition of Graph Laplacian).** For a connected graph G, the Laplacian L has eigenvalues

0 = λ₀ < λ₁ ≤ λ₂ ≤ ... ≤ λ_{N-1}

with orthonormal eigenvectors {u_k}_{k=0}^{N-1} satisfying Lu_k = λ_k u_k and u₀ = 𝟙/√N.

**Definition 5.4.2 (Spectral Gap).** The *spectral gap* is λ₁ = λ₁(L), the smallest positive eigenvalue. It quantifies the connectivity of the graph.

**Definition 5.4.3 (Cheeger Constant).** The *Cheeger constant* (isoperimetric constant) of G is

h(G) = min_{S ⊂ V, 0 < |S| ≤ N/2} |∂S| / |S|

where |∂S| = ∑_{i∈S, j∈V\S} w_{ij} is the boundary measure.

**Theorem 5.4.4 (Cheeger Inequality).** For any connected graph,

h(G)² / (2 d_{max}) ≤ λ₁ ≤ 2 h(G)

where d_{max} = max_i d_i.

**Definition 5.4.5 (Graph Fourier Transform).** The *graph Fourier transform* of u : V → ℝ is

û_k = ⟨u, u_k⟩ = ∑_{i=1}^N u_i (u_k)_i,   k = 0, 1, ..., N-1.

## Chapter 6: Discrete Difference Operators

### 6.1 Finite Difference Operators on Grids

**Definition 6.1.1 (Uniform Grid).** A *uniform grid* on [a, b] with N + 1 points is

x_j = a + jh,   j = 0, 1, ..., N,   where h = (b-a)/N.

**Definition 6.1.2 (Basic Difference Operators).** For a function u : {x₀, ..., x_N} → ℝ:

1. *Forward difference:* (D⁺_h u)_j = (u_{j+1} - u_j)/h

2. *Backward difference:* (D⁻_h u)_j = (u_j - u_{j-1})/h

3. *Central difference:* (D⁰_h u)_j = (u_{j+1} - u_{j-1})/(2h)

4. *Second central difference:* (δ²_h u)_j = (u_{j+1} - 2u_j + u_{j-1})/h²

**Theorem 6.1.3 (Truncation Error).** For u ∈ C^k([a,b]):

1. (D⁺_h u)_j = u'(x_j) + (h/2) u''(ξ_j) = u'(x_j) + O(h)

2. (D⁰_h u)_j = u'(x_j) + (h²/6) u'''(ξ_j) = u'(x_j) + O(h²)

3. (δ²_h u)_j = u''(x_j) + (h²/12) u^{(4)}(ξ_j) = u''(x_j) + O(h²)

*Proof of (3).* Taylor expand:
u_{j±1} = u_j ± h u'_j + (h²/2) u''_j ± (h³/6) u'''_j + (h⁴/24) u^{(4)}_j + O(h⁵).
Adding: u_{j+1} + u_{j-1} = 2u_j + h² u''_j + (h⁴/12) u^{(4)}_j + O(h⁶).
Rearranging gives the result. □

**Definition 6.1.4 (Order of Approximation).** A difference scheme is *of order p* for the derivative D if

‖D_h u - Du‖ ≤ C h^p ‖u‖_{C^{p+k}}

### 6.2 Discrete Laplacian on Grids

**Definition 6.2.1 (1D Discrete Laplacian).** On a grid {x₀, ..., x_N} with spacing h, the *discrete Laplacian* with Dirichlet boundary conditions is

(Δ_h u)_j = (u_{j+1} - 2u_j + u_{j-1})/h²,   j = 1, ..., N-1,

with u₀ = u_N = 0.

**Definition 6.2.2 (Matrix Representation).** The 1D discrete Laplacian is represented by the (N-1) × (N-1) tridiagonal matrix

L_h = (1/h²) [  2  -1   0  ···   0  ]
              [ -1   2  -1  ···   0  ]
              [  0  -1   2  ···   0  ]
              [  ⋮       ⋱       ⋮  ]
              [  0   0  ···  -1   2  ]

**Definition 6.2.3 (2D Discrete Laplacian).** On a rectangular grid with spacing h in both directions, the *5-point stencil* is

(Δ_h u)_{i,j} = (u_{i+1,j} + u_{i-1,j} + u_{i,j+1} + u_{i,j-1} - 4u_{i,j})/h².

**Theorem 6.2.4 (Spectral Decomposition of 1D Discrete Laplacian).** The matrix -L_h on {1, ..., N-1} has:

1. Eigenvalues: λ_k^h = (4/h²) sin²(kπh/2),   k = 1, ..., N-1

2. Eigenvectors: (u^{(k)})_j = √(2/(N)) sin(kπj/(N)) = √(2h) sin(kπx_j)

*Proof.* Substitute the eigenvector ansatz (u^{(k)})_j = sin(kπjh) into L_h u = λu and use trigonometric identities:

sin(k(j+1)πh) - 2sin(kjπh) + sin(k(j-1)πh) = -2(1 - cos(kπh)) sin(kjπh)
                                            = -4 sin²(kπh/2) sin(kjπh).

Dividing by h² gives the eigenvalue. □

**Corollary 6.2.5 (Asymptotic Eigenvalue Expansion).** As h → 0 with kπh small:

λ_k^h = (4/h²) sin²(kπh/2) = (kπ)² - (kπ)⁴ h²/12 + O(h⁴).

Thus λ_k^h → λ_k = (kπ)², the k-th eigenvalue of -d²/dx² on [0,1] with Dirichlet conditions.

### 6.3 Discrete Laplacian on Periodic Domains

**Definition 6.3.1 (Discrete Torus).** The *discrete d-dimensional torus* with N points per dimension is

𝕋^d_N = (ℤ/Nℤ)^d.

**Definition 6.3.2 (Periodic Discrete Laplacian).** On 𝕋^d_N with spacing h = 1/N, the discrete Laplacian is

(Δ_h u)_j = ∑_{k=1}^d (u_{j+e_k} + u_{j-e_k} - 2u_j)/h²

where indices are taken mod N.

**Theorem 6.3.3 (Spectral Decomposition on Discrete Torus).** The eigenfunctions are discrete Fourier modes

ψ_m(j) = exp(2πi m · j / N),   m ∈ {0, 1, ..., N-1}^d,

with eigenvalues

λ_m^h = (4/h²) ∑_{k=1}^d sin²(π m_k / N).

As N → ∞ (h → 0), for fixed m: λ_m^h → 4π² |m|² = λ_m, the eigenvalue of -Δ on 𝕋^d.

## Chapter 7: Markov Chains and Master Equations

### 7.1 Discrete-Time Markov Chains

**Definition 7.1.1 (Discrete-Time Markov Chain).** A *discrete-time Markov chain* on finite state space V = {1, ..., N} is specified by a *transition matrix* P = (P_{ij}) where:
- P_{ij} ≥ 0 (nonnegative)
- ∑_j P_{ij} = 1 for all i (stochastic)

P_{ij} = ℙ(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i) is the probability of transitioning from i to j.

**Definition 7.1.2 (Irreducibility and Aperiodicity).**
1. P is *irreducible* if for all i, j ∈ V, there exists n ≥ 0 with (P^n)_{ij} > 0.
2. P is *aperiodic* if gcd{n ≥ 1 : (P^n)_{ii} > 0} = 1 for all i.

**Theorem 7.1.3 (Convergence to Equilibrium).** If P is irreducible and aperiodic, there exists a unique stationary distribution π with π P = π and

lim_{n→∞} P^n(i, ·) = π(·)

for all starting states i.

**Definition 7.1.4 (Reversibility).** P is *reversible* with respect to π if detailed balance holds:

π_i P_{ij} = π_j P_{ji},   ∀i, j.

**Proposition 7.1.5.** If P is reversible w.r.t. π, then P is self-adjoint on ℓ²(π):

⟨Pu, v⟩_{ℓ²(π)} = ⟨u, Pv⟩_{ℓ²(π)}.

---

### 7.2 Continuous-Time Markov Chains

**Definition 7.2.1 (Generator/Rate Matrix).** A *generator* (or *rate matrix*) is a matrix Q = (q_{ij}) satisfying:
1. q_{ij} ≥ 0 for i ≠ j (nonnegative off-diagonal)
2. ∑_j q_{ij} = 0 for all i (row sums zero)

The diagonal entries are q_{ii} = -∑_{j≠i} q_{ij} ≤ 0.

**Definition 7.2.2 (Continuous-Time Markov Chain).** A CTMC with generator Q evolves as follows:
- From state i, wait exponential time with rate -q_{ii}
- Jump to state j ≠ i with probability q_{ij}/(-q_{ii})

**Definition 7.2.3 (Transition Semigroup).** The transition probabilities at time t form the matrix

P(t) = e^{tQ} = ∑_{n=0}^∞ (t^n/n!) Q^n.

P(t) is a stochastic matrix for each t ≥ 0 and satisfies P(s+t) = P(s)P(t).

**Proposition 7.2.4 (Kolmogorov Equations).** The transition matrix P(t) = e^{tQ} satisfies:

1. *Forward equation:* dP(t)/dt = P(t) Q

2. *Backward equation:* dP(t)/dt = Q P(t)

---

### 7.3 Master Equation

**Definition 7.3.1 (Master Equation).** Let π(t) = (π_1(t), ..., π_N(t)) be the probability distribution at time t. The *master equation* (Kolmogorov forward equation) is

dπ(t)/dt = π(t) Q.

In components:

dπ_i(t)/dt = ∑_{j≠i} π_j(t) q_{ji} - π_i(t) ∑_{j≠i} q_{ij}
           = ∑_{j≠i} [π_j(t) q_{ji} - π_i(t) q_{ij}].

This is the *gain-loss balance*: inflow from other states minus outflow to other states.

**Theorem 7.3.2 (Conservation of Probability).** If π(0) is a probability distribution, then π(t) = π(0) e^{tQ} is a probability distribution for all t ≥ 0.

*Proof.* Q𝟙 = 0 implies e^{tQ} 𝟙 = 𝟙, so ∑_i π_i(t) = π(0) e^{tQ} 𝟙 = π(0) 𝟙 = 1. □

**Definition 7.3.3 (Stationary Distribution).** π is *stationary* if πQ = 0, equivalently π e^{tQ} = π for all t.

**Definition 7.3.4 (Detailed Balance for CTMC).** Q is *reversible* w.r.t. π if

π_i q_{ij} = π_j q_{ji},   ∀i, j.

---

### 7.4 Graph Laplacian as Markov Generator

**Theorem 7.4.1.** Let G = (V, E, w) be a weighted graph with Laplacian L = D - A. Then Q = -L is a generator matrix:

1. q_{ij} = w_{ij} ≥ 0 for i ≠ j
2. q_{ii} = -d_i = -∑_{j≠i} w_{ij}
3. ∑_j q_{ij} = 0

The associated CTMC is a continuous-time random walk that jumps from i to j at rate w_{ij}.

**Corollary 7.4.2.** The master equation ∂_t π = π Q = -π L is equivalent to the discrete heat equation

∂_t u = L u

where u and π are related by an appropriate identification (e.g., u = π^T or u_i = π_i/μ_i for some reference measure μ).

**Proposition 7.4.3 (Stationary Distribution for Random Walk).** For the random-walk generator Q^{rw} = D^{-1}L, the stationary distribution is

π_i = d_i / (∑_k d_k).

Detailed balance holds: π_i (q^{rw})_{ij} = π_j (q^{rw})_{ji}.

h_K / ρ_K ≤ γ,   ∀K ∈ 𝒯_h, ∀h.

Shape regularity prevents degenerate (flat) elements as h → 0.

### 8.2 Finite Element Spaces

**Definition 8.2.1 (Lagrange Finite Elements).** On a triangulation 𝒯_h of Ω, the *Lagrange finite element space* of degree r is

V_h^r = {v_h ∈ C(Ω̄) | v_h|_K ∈ P_r(K) for each K ∈ 𝒯_h}

where P_r(K) denotes polynomials of degree ≤ r on K.

**Definition 8.2.2 (Conforming Subspace).** For Dirichlet problems, define

V_h^{0,r} = V_h^r ∩ H¹₀(Ω) = {v_h ∈ V_h^r | v_h = 0 on ∂Ω}.

**Theorem 8.2.3 (Approximation Property).** Let {𝒯_h} be a shape-regular family of triangulations. For u ∈ H^{k+1}(Ω) with k ≤ r:

inf_{v_h ∈ V_h^r} ‖u - v_h‖_{H^m(Ω)} ≤ C h^{k+1-m} ‖u‖_{H^{k+1}(Ω)},   0 ≤ m ≤ k+1.

### 8.3 Graph Approximations of Manifolds

**Definition 8.3.1 (Point Cloud).** A *point cloud* on a compact manifold M is a finite set X_h = {x₁, ..., x_{N_h}} ⊂ M.

**Definition 8.3.2 (Fill Distance and Separation).** For a point cloud X_h:
1. *Fill distance:* h_M(X_h) = sup_{x∈M} min_{x_i∈X_h} d_M(x, x_i)
2. *Separation:* q_M(X_h) = min_{i≠j} d_M(x_i, x_j)

A point cloud is *quasi-uniform* if h_M(X_h) / q_M(X_h) ≤ C for some C independent of h.

**Definition 8.3.3 (Neighborhood Graphs).** From a point cloud X_h, construct graphs:

1. *ε-neighborhood graph:* G_ε = (X_h, E_ε) where {x_i, x_j} ∈ E_ε iff d_M(x_i, x_j) < ε

2. *k-nearest neighbor graph:* G_k = (X_h, E_k) where {x_i, x_j} ∈ E_k iff x_j is among k nearest neighbors of x_i (or vice versa)

## Chapter 9: Operator Approximation

### 9.1 Galerkin Projection

**Definition 9.1.1 (Galerkin Projection).** Let a : V × V → ℝ be a bilinear form and V_h ⊂ V a finite-dimensional subspace. The *Galerkin projection* P_h : V → V_h is defined by

a(P_h u, v_h) = a(u, v_h),   ∀v_h ∈ V_h.

**Theorem 9.1.2 (Céa's Lemma).** If a is symmetric, bounded, and coercive with constants M and α, then

‖u - P_h u‖_a ≤ (M/α)^{1/2} inf_{v_h ∈ V_h} ‖u - v_h‖_a

where ‖·‖_a² = a(·, ·) is the energy norm.

*Proof.* For any v_h ∈ V_h, Galerkin orthogonality gives a(u - P_h u, v_h) = 0. Thus:

α ‖u - P_h u‖_V² ≤ a(u - P_h u, u - P_h u)
                  = a(u - P_h u, u - v_h)
                  ≤ M ‖u - P_h u‖_V ‖u - v_h‖_V.

Dividing and using ‖·‖_a ≈ ‖·‖_V gives the result. □

**Corollary 9.1.3 (Best Approximation).** For symmetric coercive a, the Galerkin projection is the best approximation in the energy norm:

‖u - P_h u‖_a = min_{v_h ∈ V_h} ‖u - v_h‖_a.

Find (λ_h, u_h) with u_h ∈ V_h \ {0} such that

a(u_h, v_h) = λ_h ⟨u_h, v_h⟩,   ∀v_h ∈ V_h.

**Definition 9.2.2 (Discrete Operators).** Define operators A_h : V_h → V_h and B_h : V_h → V_h by

⟨A_h u_h, v_h⟩ = a(u_h, v_h),   ⟨B_h u_h, v_h⟩ = ⟨u_h, v_h⟩_{L²}.

The discrete eigenvalue problem is A_h u_h = λ_h B_h u_h.

**Theorem 9.2.3 (Discrete Min-Max).** The k-th discrete eigenvalue satisfies

λ_k^h = min_{dim S_h = k} max_{0 ≠ u_h ∈ S_h} R(u_h)

where R(u_h) = a(u_h, u_h) / ‖u_h‖_{L²}² is the Rayleigh quotient.

∫_Ω ∇u_h · ∇v_h dx = ∫_Ω f_h v_h dx,   ∀v_h ∈ V_h.

**Definition 9.3.2 (Stiffness and Mass Matrices).** Let {φ₁, ..., φ_M} be a basis of V_h. Define:

1. *Stiffness matrix:* K_{ij} = ∫_Ω ∇φ_i · ∇φ_j dx

2. *Mass matrix:* M_{ij} = ∫_Ω φ_i φ_j dx

The discrete eigenvalue problem becomes the generalized eigenvalue problem K u = λ M u.

### 9.4 Graph Laplacian as Discretization

**Theorem 9.4.1 (Convergence of Graph Laplacian Forms).** Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold, μ a measure with positive bounded density ρ, and X_h a sequence of samples with h_M(X_h) → 0. Let

E_h(f) = (1/(N_h ε_h^{d+2})) ∑_{i,j} K(d_M(x_i, x_j)/ε_h) (f(x_i) - f(x_j))²

be the discrete Dirichlet form with bandwidth ε_h. If ε_h → 0 and N_h ε_h^d → ∞, then for smooth u:

E_h(u|_{X_h}) → c_K ∫_M |∇_g u|² ρ² dvol_g

where c_K > 0 depends only on the kernel K.

**Definition 9.4.2 (Graph Laplacian on Point Cloud).** The graph Laplacian on X_h with kernel K and bandwidth ε is

(L_h f)_i = (1/ε²) ∑_j K(d_M(x_i, x_j)/ε) (f_i - f_j).

**Theorem 9.4.3 (Pointwise Consistency).** For smooth u ∈ C^∞(M) and under regularity conditions on the sampling and kernel:

(L_h u|_{X_h})_i = c_K Δ_g u(x_i) ρ(x_i) + O(ε) + O(h_M/ε)

**Definition 10.1.2 (Norm Convergence).** T_n → T in *operator norm* if

‖T_n - T‖_{op} = sup_{‖x‖=1} ‖T_n x - T x‖ → 0.

**Definition 10.1.3 (Strong Resolvent Convergence).** Self-adjoint operators A_n → A in the *strong resolvent sense* if

R(z; A_n) := (A_n - zI)^{-1} → R(z; A) := (A - zI)^{-1} strongly

for all z ∈ ρ(A) ∩ (∩_n ρ(A_n)), where ρ denotes the resolvent set.

### 10.2 Convergence of Quadratic Forms

**Definition 10.2.1 (Mosco Convergence).** A sequence of closed quadratic forms a_n on H *Mosco converges* to a if:

1. *Liminf condition:* For every sequence u_n ⇀ u weakly in H,
   a(u) ≤ liminf_{n→∞} a_n(u_n).

2. *Limsup condition:* For every u ∈ D(a), there exists u_n → u strongly with
   a(u) ≥ limsup_{n→∞} a_n(u_n).

**Theorem 10.2.2 (Kato's Theorem).** Let A_n, A be nonnegative self-adjoint operators with associated closed forms a_n, a. Then:

a_n → a (Mosco) ⟹ R(z; A_n) → R(z; A) strongly for z ∈ ℂ \ [0, ∞).

### 10.3 Eigenvalue Convergence

**Theorem 10.3.1 (Eigenvalue Monotonicity).** Let V_h ⊂ V_{h'} ⊂ V be nested subspaces with ∪_h V_h dense in V. Let λ_k^h be the k-th Rayleigh-Ritz eigenvalue on V_h. Then:

λ_k ≤ λ_k^{h'} ≤ λ_k^h   for h' < h.

As h → 0: λ_k^h ↓ λ_k.

*Proof.* The min-max characterization gives:

λ_k^h = min_{S_h ⊂ V_h, dim S_h = k} max_{u ∈ S_h} R(u).

If V_h ⊂ V_{h'}, then the minimum is taken over a larger class for V_{h'}, yielding a smaller value. □

**Theorem 10.3.2 (Eigenvalue Error Bound).** Under Galerkin discretization with nested spaces:

0 ≤ λ_k^h - λ_k ≤ C_k δ_k(h)²

where δ_k(h) = inf_{v_h ∈ V_h} ‖φ_k - v_h‖_a is the best-approximation error for the k-th eigenfunction in the energy norm.

*Proof Sketch.* By the min-max principle and approximation properties:

λ_k^h ≤ max_{u ∈ E_k^h} R(u)

where E_k^h = span{P_h φ₁, ..., P_h φ_k} for the Galerkin projection P_h. The bound follows from Taylor expansion of R near the eigenspace. □

**Theorem 10.3.3 (Eigenvector Convergence - Simple Eigenvalue).** If λ_k is simple and A_h → A in strong resolvent sense, then (for appropriate choice of sign):

u_k^h → φ_k in H.

*Proof Sketch.* The spectral projections E_h({λ_k^h}) converge strongly to E({λ_k}) by resolvent convergence. Since dim E({λ_k}) = 1, any normalized vector in E_h({λ_k^h}) converges to ±φ_k. □

**Theorem 10.3.4 (Eigenspace Convergence - Multiple Eigenvalue).** Let λ_k have multiplicity m with eigenspace E_k = span{φ_k, ..., φ_{k+m-1}} and let E_k^h = span{u_k^h, ..., u_{k+m-1}^h}. Then E_k^h → E_k in the *gap topology*:

gap(E_k^h, E_k) := max{sup_{u ∈ E_k, ‖u‖=1} dist(u, E_k^h), sup_{v ∈ E_k^h, ‖v‖=1} dist(v, E_k)} → 0.

|λ_k^h - λ_k| ≤ C_k h^{2r} ‖φ_k‖_{H^{r+1}}².

**Theorem 10.4.2 (Convergence Rate for Graph Laplacians).** Under appropriate conditions on the sampling X_h and bandwidth ε_h:

|λ_k^h - c_K λ_k| = O(ε_h) + O(h_M/ε_h)

where λ_k^h are eigenvalues of the normalized graph Laplacian and λ_k are eigenvalues of -Δ_M.

1. *Lie-Trotter splitting:*
   S_{LT}(Δt) = S_D(Δt) S_Ω(Δt)
   where S_D(t) = e^{tD}, S_Ω(t) = e^{tΩ}.

2. *Strang splitting:*
   S_{Str}(Δt) = S_D(Δt/2) S_Ω(Δt) S_D(Δt/2)

**Theorem 12.2.4 (Splitting Error).** For bounded operators D, Ω:

1. Lie-Trotter: ‖e^{Δt(D+Ω)} - S_{LT}(Δt)‖ = O(Δt²)

2. Strang: ‖e^{Δt(D+Ω)} - S_{Str}(Δt)‖ = O(Δt³)

### 12.3 Unitary Hybrid Operators (Phase-Based)

**Definition 12.3.1 (Unitary Hybrid Operator).** For Hermitian D, Ω, the *unitary hybrid operator* is

H = e^{i(D + Ω)}

or the split approximation H ≈ e^{iD} e^{iΩ}.

**Definition 12.3.2 (Phase Kick).** A *phase kick* operator is diagonal in the configuration basis:

D |x⟩ = f(x) |x⟩

for some cost/energy function f : 𝒳_d → ℝ. This implements the transformation |x⟩ ↦ e^{if(x)} |x⟩.

**Definition 12.3.3 (Mixing Operator).** A *mixing operator* Ω couples configurations, typically:

Ω = -t L

where L is a graph Laplacian on 𝒳_d or a discrete approximation of a continuous Laplacian.

**Proposition 12.3.4 (Grover Iteration as Hybrid).** Grover's algorithm uses:
- D = diagonal phase flip on marked states
- Ω = "inversion about mean" = 2|s⟩⟨s| - I where |s⟩ = uniform superposition

## Chapter 13: Canonical Hybrid Patterns

### 13.1 Relax-Project Pattern

**Definition 13.1.1 (Relax-Project Generator).** The *relax-project* pattern has generator

G = Ω_{relax} + D_{project}

where:
- Ω_{relax}: continuous gradient flow or diffusion in relaxed space
- D_{project}: discrete projection to feasible set

**Example 13.1.2 (Projected Gradient Descent).** For minimizing f(x) over discrete set 𝒳_d:

1. Relax to convex hull: 𝒳_c = conv(𝒳_d)
2. Ω_{relax}: gradient flow dx/dt = -∇f(x)
3. D_{project}: projection Π : 𝒳_c → 𝒳_d (e.g., rounding)

Hybrid iteration: x^{n+1} = Π(x^n - η∇f(x^n))

**Theorem 13.1.3 (Convergence of Relax-Project).** If:
1. Ω_{relax} has a Lyapunov function V with dV/dt ≤ -α V
2. D_{project} satisfies |V(Π(x)) - V(x)| ≤ β for x in relaxed space
3. β/α is small

Then the hybrid dynamics converges to near-optimal solutions.

---

### 13.2 Flow-Prune Pattern

**Definition 13.2.1 (Flow-Prune Generator).** The *flow-prune* pattern maintains an active set 𝒜(t) ⊂ 𝒮 with:

G = Ω_{flow} + D_{prune}

where:
- Ω_{flow}: updates scores/bounds x_s for s ∈ 𝒜
- D_{prune}: removes states s where bounds certify non-optimality

**Example 13.2.2 (Branch and Bound with Gradient Scoring).** For combinatorial optimization:

1. 𝒮 = partial solutions (tree nodes)
2. x_s = LP relaxation bound
3. Ω_{flow}: interior point method dynamics on relaxation
4. D_{prune}: remove s if x_s > best known solution

**Definition 13.2.3 (Pruning Operator).**

(D_{prune} z)_s = 
  z_s,  if E(s, x_s) < threshold
  0,    otherwise

where E is the evaluation function.

---

### 13.3 Sampling-Mixing Pattern

**Definition 13.3.1 (Sampling-Mixing Generator).** For sampling from target π:

G = Ω_{transport} + D_{correct}

where:
- Ω_{transport}: Langevin dynamics, Hamiltonian flow, or gradient transport
- D_{correct}: Metropolis-Hastings acceptance/rejection

**Example 13.3.2 (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo).**

1. State space: (position q, momentum p)
2. Ω_{transport}: Hamiltonian flow dq/dt = ∂H/∂p, dp/dt = -∂H/∂q
3. D_{correct}: accept/reject based on energy difference

**Theorem 13.3.3 (Mixing Time Improvement).** HMC with well-chosen integration time T achieves mixing time

τ_{mix} = O(κ^{1/2})

compared to τ_{mix} = O(κ) for random-walk Metropolis, where κ is condition number.

---

### 13.4 Consensus-Synchronization Pattern

**Definition 13.4.1 (Consensus-Sync Generator).** On a network G = (V, E):

G = Ω_{sync} + D_{protocol}

where:
- Ω_{sync}: phase synchronization dynamics (e.g., Kuramoto)
- D_{protocol}: discrete protocol steps (voting, commit)

**Example 13.4.2 (Kuramoto Synchronization).**

dθ_i/dt = ω_i + ∑_j K_{ij} sin(θ_j - θ_i)

where θ_i is phase at node i, ω_i is natural frequency, K_{ij} is coupling strength.

**Definition 13.4.3 (Order Parameter).** The *Kuramoto order parameter* is

r e^{iΨ} = (1/N) ∑_k e^{iθ_k}

with r ∈ [0, 1] measuring synchronization and Ψ the mean phase.

---

## Chapter 14: Shortcut Mechanisms

### 14.1 Geometric Speed

**Principle 14.1.1.** Continuous flows exploit geometric structure (curvature, gradients, global connectivity) to make coordinated moves across many dimensions simultaneously.

**Theorem 14.1.2 (Gradient Flow Convergence).** For λ-strongly convex f with L-Lipschitz gradient, gradient flow dx/dt = -∇f(x) satisfies:

f(x(t)) - f(x*) ≤ e^{-2λt} (f(x(0)) - f(x*))

This exponential rate is achieved by continuous global moves, not local steps.

**Corollary 14.1.3.** Discretizing with step size η = 1/L gives:

f(x^n) - f(x*) ≤ (1 - λ/L)^n (f(x^0) - f(x*))

which requires n = O(κ log(1/ε)) iterations where κ = L/λ.

---

### 14.2 Combinatorial Fidelity

**Principle 14.2.1.** Discrete projections immediately enforce constraints that continuous relaxations can only approximately satisfy.

**Definition 14.2.2 (Integrality Gap).** For an optimization problem with integer constraint:

gap = (optimal relaxed value) / (optimal integer value)

**Theorem 14.2.3 (Rounding Guarantee).** If a rounding scheme Π satisfies:

f(Π(x)) ≤ α f(x*_{relaxed}) + β

for all relaxed solutions x, then the hybrid relax-project achieves α-approximation (plus additive β).

---

### 14.3 Spectral Preconditioning

**Principle 14.3.1.** Continuous operators can transform the spectrum of discrete problems, reducing effective condition number.

**Definition 14.3.2 (Preconditioner).** For linear system Ax = b, a *preconditioner* P approximates A⁻¹ such that PA has spectrum clustered near 1.

**Theorem 14.3.3 (Preconditioned Convergence).** Conjugate gradient on PAx = Pb converges in

k = O(√(κ(PA)) log(1/ε))

iterations, where κ(PA) is the condition number of PA. Good preconditioners achieve κ(PA) << κ(A).

**Example 14.3.4 (Multigrid as Hybrid Preconditioning).** Multigrid combines:
- Ω: smoothing on fine grid (reduces high-frequency error)
- D: restriction to coarse grid, solve, prolongation (reduces low-frequency error)

This achieves O(N) complexity for elliptic problems.

---

### 14.4 Coherent Amplitude Re-use (Phase-Based)

**Principle 14.4.1.** Unitary dynamics explores exponentially many paths simultaneously; interference amplifies desired states.

**Theorem 14.4.2 (Grover Speedup).** For unstructured search over N items with M marked:

- Classical: Ω(N/M) queries
- Quantum (Grover): O(√(N/M)) queries

**Definition 14.4.3 (Amplitude Amplification).** Starting from |ψ⟩ with amplitude a on good states, repeated application of G = (2|ψ⟩⟨ψ| - I)(2Π_good - I) rotates toward good states at rate Θ(|a|) per iteration.

**Theorem 14.4.4 (Optimal Iterations).** Maximum probability on good states is achieved after

k* ≈ (π/4) / arcsin(|a|) ≈ (π/4) / |a|

iterations, giving success probability ≈ 1.

## Chapter 16: Analysis of Hybrid Systems

### 16.1 Lyapunov Analysis

**Definition 16.1.1 (Lyapunov Function).** A function V : 𝒵 → ℝ is a *Lyapunov function* for hybrid system z' = Gz if:

1. V ≥ 0 with V(z) = 0 iff z is equilibrium
2. dV/dt = ⟨∇V, Gz⟩ ≤ 0

**Theorem 16.1.2 (Lyapunov Stability).** If V is a Lyapunov function with dV/dt ≤ -αV for α > 0, then:

V(z(t)) ≤ e^{-αt} V(z(0))

and z(t) → equilibrium exponentially.

**Theorem 16.1.3 (Composite Lyapunov for Hybrids).** If:
1. V_Ω(z) decreases under Ω: ⟨∇V_Ω, Ωz⟩ ≤ -α_Ω V_Ω
2. V_D(z) decreases under D: ⟨∇V_D, Dz⟩ ≤ -α_D V_D
3. Cross terms are controlled: |⟨∇V_Ω, Dz⟩| + |⟨∇V_D, Ωz⟩| ≤ β(V_Ω + V_D)

Then V = V_Ω + V_D is a Lyapunov function for G = D + Ω if α_Ω + α_D > β.

---

### 16.2 Spectral Analysis

**Theorem 16.2.1 (Spectrum of Additive Generator).** For G = D + Ω with [D, Ω] = 0 (commuting):

σ(G) = σ(D) + σ(Ω) = {λ + μ : λ ∈ σ(D), μ ∈ σ(Ω)}.

**Theorem 16.2.2 (Non-Commuting Perturbation).** For G = D + Ω with ‖[D, Ω]‖ = O(ε):

σ(G) = σ(D) + σ(Ω) + O(ε).

The spectral gap of G is approximately min(gap(D), gap(Ω)) for small coupling.

**Definition 16.2.3 (Mixing Time).** For Markov generator G, the *mixing time* is

τ_{mix} = min{t : ‖e^{tG} μ - π‖_{TV} ≤ 1/4 for all initial μ}

**Theorem 16.2.4 (Spectral Gap and Mixing).** 

τ_{mix} = Θ(1/gap(G))

where gap(G) = λ₁(-G) is the spectral gap.

---

### 16.3 Approximation Bounds

**Definition 16.3.1 (Approximation Ratio).** An algorithm is an *α-approximation* if it always produces a solution of value at most α times optimal (for minimization).

**Theorem 16.3.2 (Integrality Gap Bound).** A relax-project algorithm cannot achieve approximation ratio better than the integrality gap of the relaxation.

**Theorem 16.3.3 (Hybrid Approximation Composition).** If:
1. Relaxation achieves value V_{rel}
2. Rounding loses factor α: V_{round} ≤ α V_{rel}
3. Optimal value is OPT

Then hybrid achieves α · (V_{rel}/OPT)-approximation.

## Appendix B: Key Theorems and Proofs

### B.1 Spectral Convergence Proofs

**Theorem B.1.1 (Courant-Fischer Min-Max).** For self-adjoint A with discrete spectrum:

λ_k = min_{dim S = k} max_{u ∈ S, u ≠ 0} (⟨Au, u⟩)/(⟨u, u⟩).

*Proof.* Let {φ_1, ..., φ_k, ...} be orthonormal eigenvectors with Aφ_j = λ_j φ_j.

(i) Upper bound: Take S = span{φ_1, ..., φ_k}. For u = ∑_{j=1}^k c_j φ_j:

⟨Au, u⟩/⟨u, u⟩ = (∑_j λ_j |c_j|²)/(∑_j |c_j|²) ≤ λ_k.

So max_{u∈S} R(u) = λ_k, achieved at u = φ_k.

(ii) Lower bound: For any k-dimensional S, we show S ∩ span{φ_k, φ_{k+1}, ...}⊥ ≠ {0} implies existence of u with R(u) ≥ λ_k.

Since dim(S) = k and dim(span{φ_1, ..., φ_{k-1}}) = k-1 < k, there exists 0 ≠ u ∈ S with u ⊥ φ_1, ..., φ_{k-1}. Write u = ∑_{j≥k} c_j φ_j. Then

R(u) = (∑_{j≥k} λ_j |c_j|²)/(∑_{j≥k} |c_j|²) ≥ λ_k.

Thus min_S max_{u∈S} R(u) = λ_k. □

**Theorem B.1.2 (Monotonicity under Refinement).** If V_h ⊂ V_{h'} ⊂ V with ∪ V_h dense, then λ_k^{h'} ≤ λ_k^h and λ_k^h ↓ λ_k.

*Proof.* By Courant-Fischer:

λ_k^h = min_{S_h ⊂ V_h, dim=k} max_{u∈S_h} R(u).

Since V_h ⊂ V_{h'}, any S_h ⊂ V_h is also in V_{h'}, so the min in V_{h'} is over a larger class:

λ_k^{h'} = min_{S_{h'} ⊂ V_{h'}} max R ≤ min_{S_h ⊂ V_h} max R = λ_k^h.

The limit follows from density: for any ε > 0 and any k-dimensional S ⊂ V achieving λ_k + ε, there exist S_h ⊂ V_h with dist(S, S_h) → 0, giving λ_k^h → λ_k. □

---

### B.2 Semigroup Convergence Proofs

**Theorem B.2.1 (Trotter-Kato).** Let A_n, A be generators of contraction semigroups. If R(λ; A_n) → R(λ; A) strongly for some λ > 0, then e^{tA_n} → e^{tA} strongly, uniformly on compact t-intervals.

*Proof Sketch.* 

(i) Strong resolvent convergence implies convergence of all resolvents by resolvent identity.

(ii) Yosida approximation: A_n^{(m)} = m A_n R(m; A_n) are bounded generators with e^{tA_n^{(m)}} → e^{tA_n} as m → ∞.

(iii) For bounded generators, e^{tB_n} → e^{tB} if B_n → B strongly.

(iv) Combine: first take m → ∞, then n → ∞, using uniform bounds from contraction property. □

**Corollary B.2.2 (Heat Semigroup Convergence).** Under Mosco convergence of Dirichlet forms a_h → a:

‖e^{-tA_h} f - e^{-tA} f‖ → 0

for all f ∈ L² and uniformly for t in compact subsets of (0, ∞).

## Appendix D: Convergence Rate Summary

### D.1 Finite Element Eigenvalue Convergence

For Lagrange P_r elements on shape-regular mesh with φ_k ∈ H^{r+1}:

|λ_k^h - λ_k| ≤ C_k h^{2r} ‖φ_k‖²_{H^{r+1}}

### D.2 Finite Difference Eigenvalue Convergence

For second-order central differences on uniform grid:

λ_k^h = λ_k + O(h²)

Specifically for 1D Dirichlet:

λ_k^h = (kπ)² - (kπ)⁴ h²/12 + O(h⁴)

### D.3 Graph Laplacian Eigenvalue Convergence

For kernel-weighted graph Laplacian with bandwidth ε, sample spacing h_M:

|λ_k^h - c_K λ_k| = O(ε) + O(h_M/ε)

Optimal choice ε ∼ h_M^{2/(d+2)} gives:

|λ_k^h - c_K λ_k| = O(h_M^{2/(d+2)})

### D.4 Eigenvector Convergence

Under spectral convergence with simple λ_k:

‖u_k^h - φ_k‖_{L²} = O(δ_k(h))

where δ_k(h) = inf_{v_h ∈ V_h} ‖φ_k - v_h‖ is best approximation error.
