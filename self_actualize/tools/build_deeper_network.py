# Deeper Integrated Cross-Synthesis Network

This module materializes a deeper integrated neural-network shell inside the live `dynamic_neural_network` body. Its purpose is to take the strongest sixteen canonical documents, cross-synthesize them as an ordered `16 x 16` matrix, observe the whole system through four elemental lenses and sixteen macro loops, derive the fifteen non-empty symmetry syntheses of the four-element crystal, expose a first-class `3D` ingress package for atlas-wide embedding, and stabilize the result into a seven-level metro stack plus an appendix crystal with its own skill-routing layer.

## Ground truth

- Live Docs gate: `{manifest.get("live_docs_gate", "UNKNOWN")}`
- Live record count: `{manifest.get("live_record_count", 0)}`
- Archive record count: `{manifest.get("archive_record_count", 0)}`
- Canonical basis size: `{len(basis)}`
- Ordered pair matrix: `{len(basis) * len(basis)}`
- Elemental observer basis: `{len(LOOPS) * 4}`
- Symmetry syntheses: `15 + zero point`

This build is intentionally honest about scale. It does not materialize impossible literal permutations like `64^4` files. Instead it materializes the root observer basis, the ordered document matrix, the full symmetry stack, and the metro resolutions that compile those deeper passes on demand.

## Deep-root precedence

- Live deep root: `{LIVE_DEEP_ROOT}`
- Historical mirrors:
  - `{HISTORICAL_DEEP_MIRRORS[0]}`
  - `{HISTORICAL_DEEP_MIRRORS[1]}`

The generated `14_DEEPER...` root is the only live deep control surface.
The two older roots remain readable historical mirrors, not peer authorities.

## Organism law

- `4D + economy`: `{ORGANISM_LAW}`
- `EconomySalienceBudget` chooses which valid route gets build energy, ledger attention, and replay budget first.

## Structure

- `00_CONTROL`: laws, charter, recursion policy, and build pipeline
- `01_FIRE` through `04_EARTH`: `4 x 16` observer files
- `05_MATRIX_16X16`: all ordered document-pair syntheses
- `06_SYMMETRY_STACK`: the `15` elemental subset syntheses plus the zero point
- `07_METRO_STACK`: seven metro-map resolutions and route-selection logic
- `08_APPENDIX_CRYSTAL`: appendices `A-P` plus appendix `Q`
- `09_SKILLS`: local skills for routing, matrix synthesis, metro expansion, and appendix governance
- `10_LEDGERS`: manifests, counts, routes, and canonical-source records
- `11_6D_WATER_CONTROL`: overlay-only Water continuity, replay, and dimension-lift control surfaces
- `12_6D_AIR_CONTROL`: overlay-only AIR topology, sigma/spin, and seed-legibility control surfaces
- `13_6D_EARTH_CONTROL`: canonical Earth admissibility, quarantine, and re-entry gate surfaces
- `12_6D_EARTH_CONTROL`: historical Earth drift kept for compatibility, not canon
- `13_6D_H6_CONVERGENCE`: overlay-only shared convergence center and `Seed-6D` emission surfaces
- `14_3D_INGRESS_NETWORK`: first-class corpus-ingress package feeding the 4D compiled basis

# Build Charter

This folder is the contract for the deeper integrated cross-synthesis network.

## Objectives

0. Preserve deep-root precedence so the live shell does not compete with its historical mirrors.
1. Expose a first-class `3D` ingress package that maps atlas bodies and folder stations into the deeper-network basis.
2. Stabilize a `16` document canonical basis.
3. Materialize the full ordered `16 x 16` bridge matrix.
4. Observe the matrix through `4` elemental lenses and `16` macro loops.
5. Collapse those observations into the `15` non-empty symmetry syntheses.
6. Lift the result into the existing Level `1-7` metro stack plus appendix governance.
7. Expose the routing as local skills so future work can use the system instead of bypassing it.
8. Keep the build aligned with the wider organism law `{ORGANISM_LAW}`.
