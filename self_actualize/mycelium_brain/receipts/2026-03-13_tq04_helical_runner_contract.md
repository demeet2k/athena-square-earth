# 2026-03-13 tq04 helical runner contract

- truth: `OK`
- docs gate: `BLOCKED`
- temple frontier: `TQ04`
- hall feeder: `Q42`
- active Hall subfront: `QS64-20 Connectivity-Diagnose-Fractal`
- released next Hall seed: `QS64-21 Connectivity-Refine-Square`

## Docs gate truth

- `Trading Bot/credentials.json`: `MISSING`
- `Trading Bot/token.json`: `MISSING`
- live Google Docs access remains blocked, so this pass is local-only and does not claim Docs witness

## Source witness basis

- `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/70_SCHEMAS/06_HELICAL_LOOPSPEC_16_RING.md`
- `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/70_SCHEMAS/07_PHASE_SPEC_2_TO_14_MACHINE.md`

## Landed artifacts

- machine contract: `self_actualize/helical_runner_contract.json`
- machine verification: `self_actualize/helical_runner_contract_verification.json`
- human-readable contract surface: `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/95_MANIFESTS/TQ04_HELICAL_RUNNER_CONTRACT.md`
- live loop witness: `ATHENA TEMPLE/MANIFESTS/16_LOOP_PROGRESS.md`

## Contract summary

The helical schema pack now exits doctrine as one replay-safe runner contract instead of
remaining a proposed Temple handoff. The landed contract binds:

- blocked Docs truth as an explicit external gate
- `Q39` runtime-trust packet pressure as the receiving contradiction pressure
- `Q41 / TQ06` as the active hourly packet-fed cadence membrane
- `Q42 -> QS64-20 Connectivity-Diagnose-Fractal` as the current Hall-side feeder
- `TQ04` as the landed Temple-side binding witness
- `Q42 -> QS64-21 Connectivity-Refine-Square` as the released next Hall seed after contract landing

## Executable proof bundle

- sparse activation example included in `self_actualize/helical_runner_contract.json`
- `2/16 -> 14/16` phase-machine walk included and complete
- metric tensor audit covers all `16` canonical metrics
- lift-quality gate enforces the `0.125` rule and records verdict `OK`
- verifier command:
  `python -m self_actualize.runtime.verify_helical_runner_contract`
- verifier truth after writeback:
  `OK`

## Governance writeback

- Temple quest board now marks `TQ04` as `[PROMOTED 2026-03-13]`
- Temple state now names `TQ04` as the landed contract witness while `TQ06` remains active cadence control
- `16_LOOP_PROGRESS.md` now advances from `7/16` to active `8/16 Representation And Registry Synthesis`
- Hall queue and restart surfaces now remove `Q02` as the immediate `TQ04` next seed
- `Q42` remains `OPEN` on `QS64-20 Connectivity-Diagnose-Fractal`
- `QS64-21 Connectivity-Refine-Square` is released only as the next Hall seed and is not claimed as current

## Honest residual

- the Docs gate is still blocked by missing OAuth material
- `Q42` still needs Hall-side execution on the current Fractal corridor
- `QS64-21` is released next but not yet promoted into current Hall work
- broader QSHRINK generator outputs still need periodic freshness discipline because historical refine logic exists in the runtime family

## Restart seed

`Keep TQ06 active as the hourly packet-fed control membrane, keep Q42 current on QS64-20 Connectivity-Diagnose-Fractal, keep TQ04 landed as the runner-contract witness, release QS64-21 Connectivity-Refine-Square only as the next Hall seed, keep P2 Athena OS runtime promoted-current, keep P3 ORGIN queue-visible, keep Q45 secondary, and keep Q02 blocked while the Docs gate remains BLOCKED.`
