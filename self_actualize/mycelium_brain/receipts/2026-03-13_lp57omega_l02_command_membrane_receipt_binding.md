# LP-57Omega L02 :: Command Membrane Receipt Binding

- Date: `2026-03-13`
- Docs gate: `BLOCKED / LOCAL_WITNESS_ONLY`
- Parent authority: `NEXT57`
- Local membrane: `COMMAND_MEMBRANE_V1`
- Active loop: `L02 Survey :: A02 self_actualize`
- Next Hall quest: `NEXT57-H-COMMAND-MEMBRANE`
- Next Temple quest: `NEXT57-T-COMMAND-LAW`
- Restart seed: `L03 Survey A03 ECOSYSTEM`

## Landed

- Rebound the live command lane to the receipt-binding authority surfaces:
  - `self_actualize/next57_command_protocol.json`
  - `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/ledgers/command_membrane/command_membrane_state.json`
  - `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/95_MANIFESTS/COMMAND_MEMBRANE_STATE.json`
- Normalized committed event rows to carry explicit route, claim, receipt, and replay refs.
- Reclassified incomplete command rows as pending replay instead of silently treating them as committed.
- Synced the command marker blocks in `ACTIVE_RUN`, `BUILD_QUEUE`, Hall, Temple, and the live active queue to the command lane.
- Patched both command entrypoints so the wrapper file and package module now rebuild the same receipt-bound membrane state.

## Verified

- `EVT-20260313-0007` now resolves end-to-end with:
  - `CommandEventPacketV1`
  - `RouteDecisionV1`
  - `ClaimLeaseV1`
  - `ArchivistReceiptV1`
  - replay pointer
- Stable route path: `SCOUT-01>ROUTER-01>WORKER-02>ARCHIVIST-01`
- Stable claimant: `WORKER-02`
- Archivist summary: `aligned packet schema probe for command membrane v1`
- Queue truth after refresh:
  - `queue_depth = 4`
  - `active_leases = 0`
  - `pending_replay_count = 4`
  - `command_live_event_ledger.json` now publishes a `rows` object payload
- Capillary truth after refresh:
  - `edge_count = 1`
  - top lane `SCOUT-01>ROUTER-01>WORKER-02>ARCHIVIST-01`
  - grade `vein`
- Public mirrors agree on:
  - active loop `L02 Survey :: A02 self_actualize`
  - next Hall quest `NEXT57-H-COMMAND-MEMBRANE`
  - next Temple quest `NEXT57-T-COMMAND-LAW`
  - restart seed `L03 Survey A03 ECOSYSTEM`

## Witness Refs

- `self_actualize/lp57_omega_v2_artifacts/L02/command_membrane_receipt_binding.json`
- `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/ledgers/command_membrane/command_live_event_ledger.json`
- `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/ledgers/command_membrane/command_claim_ledger.json`
- `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/ledgers/command_membrane/command_capillary_edges.json`
- `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/ledgers/command_membrane/command_membrane_state.json`

## Honesty Boundary

Google Docs remain blocked because `Trading Bot/credentials.json` and `Trading Bot/token.json` are missing, so this pass stayed local-evidence only.
