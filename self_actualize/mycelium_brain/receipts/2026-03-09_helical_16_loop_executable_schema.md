# Helical 16-Loop Executable Schema Receipt

Date: `2026-03-09`
Verdict: `OK`

## Quest

`Q24: Compile The Helical 16-Loop Recursion Architecture Into Executable Schemas`

## FrontID

`FRONT-Q24-HELICAL-SCHEMA`

## Docs Gate Check

Attempted first as required.

Result:

- `FAIL`
- blocker preserved exactly:
  `Trading Bot/credentials.json` and `Trading Bot/token.json` are missing

## Core Formalization

This pass hardened the complement-lift theorem into canonical schema form.

The controlling separation is now explicit:

1. arithmetic reduction:
   `2/16 = 1/8`
2. intra-layer complement:
   `C_n(2) = 14`
3. inter-layer bridge-equivalence:
   `14/16|n ≡ 2/16|n+1`

That means Athena now has a typed way to distinguish:

- scalar quantity
- root-address state
- recursive bridge state

## Landed Canonical Schemas

1. `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/70_SCHEMAS/06_HELICAL_LOOPSPEC_16_RING.md`
2. `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/70_SCHEMAS/07_PHASE_SPEC_2_TO_14_MACHINE.md`
3. `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/70_SCHEMAS/08_VIRTUAL_SWARM_SPEC_16X16.md`
4. `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/70_SCHEMAS/09_IMPROVEMENT_LEDGER_SPEC.md`
5. `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/70_SCHEMAS/10_LIFT_SPEC_ONE_EIGHTH_HELIX.md`

## What Became Executable

1. the 16 macro loops are now named as a typed `LoopSpec`
2. the `2/16 -> 14/16` visible cycle is now a typed `PhaseSpec`
3. the `16^16` swarm is now lawful through sparse factorized activation
4. post-loop expansion pressure is now normalized by a deterministic `ImprovementLedgerSpec`
5. the `1/8` dimensional lift is now guarded by explicit function, coverage, and bloat rules
