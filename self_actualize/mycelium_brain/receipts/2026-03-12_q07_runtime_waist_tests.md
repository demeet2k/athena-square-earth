# Q07 Runtime Waist Tests Receipt

- Date: `2026-03-12`
- Quest: `Q07 Harden The Runtime Waist With Tests`
- Verdict: `OK`
- Derivation command: `python -m self_actualize.runtime.verify_runtime_waist`

## Objective

Create one repeatable local verification harness around the runtime waist so
`engine.py`, `atlas.py`, and `swarm_board.py` stop depending on ambient trust.

## Witness

- machine witness:
  `self_actualize/runtime_waist_verification.json`
- runtime verifier:
  `self_actualize/runtime/verify_runtime_waist.py`
- wrapper:
  `self_actualize/tools/verify_runtime_waist.py`
- queue writeback:
  `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/06_active_queue.md`
- manifest writeback:
  `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/95_MANIFESTS/ACTIVE_RUN.md`

## Passed Checks

1. `atlas_contract`
2. `engine_packet`
3. `swarm_board_pipeline`
4. `swarm_board_build_command`

The verifier records the current truth honestly:

- Docs gate remains `BLOCKED`
- Atlas search still resolves the runtime waist directly
- Engine packet synthesis still collapses lawfully with replay hash and tri-lock
- Swarm Board still recompiles locally through the real `build` command

## Law Landed

The runtime waist is no longer trusted only because recent quests wrote into it.
It now has a reusable verifier lane that another agent can rerun before promoting
new runtime weight.

## Next Seed

`FRONT-INT-SKILL-COHESION`
