# 2026-03-13 q42 cloud state synchronization

- truth: `OK`
- docs gate: `BLOCKED`
- hall frontier: `Q42`
- active subfront: `QS64-19 Connectivity-Diagnose-Cloud`
- next seed: `QS64-20 Connectivity-Diagnose-Fractal`

## Docs gate truth

- `Trading Bot/credentials.json`: `MISSING`
- `Trading Bot/token.json`: `MISSING`
- live Docs access remains blocked, so this pass is local-only and does not claim Google Docs witness

## Authoritative witness basis

- `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/receipts/2026-03-13_q42_flower_pass_activation.md`
- `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/receipts/2026-03-13_qs64_19_core_corridor_cloud.md`
- `self_actualize/q42_runtime_corridor_membrane.json`
- `self_actualize/q42_orgin_seed_packet_witness.json`
- `self_actualize/qshrink_connectivity_cloud.json`

## Actual blocker

The blocker was not missing Cloud witness.
The blocker was control-plane drift:

- generator-owned QSHRINK outputs were still emitting stale Flower-current state
- Hall, queue, Temple, and restart surfaces had also begun to narrate premature `QS64-20` carrythrough
- the Flower-only activator still had the ability to overwrite live control surfaces if rerun without a guard

## Landed corrections

- patched `self_actualize/runtime/derive_qshrink_network_integration.py` so live current state is read from the Cloud witness and Fractal stays the next seed
- preserved the Flower-only activator as historical witness by guarding it from overwriting a live Cloud or Fractal control plane
- regenerated:
  - `self_actualize/qshrink_network_integration.json`
  - `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/manifests/QSHRINK_ACTIVE_FRONT.md`
  - `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/families/FAMILY_qshrink_athena_internal_use.md`
  - `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/families/FAMILY_qshrink_athena_internal_use_route_map.md`
  - `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/50_CORPUS_CAPSULES/qshrink/02_qshrink_shiva_corpus_ecosystem.md`
  - `self_actualize/qshrink_agent_task_matrix.json`
  - `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/GLOBAL_EMERGENT_GUILD_HALL/13_QSHRINK_LOOPED_AGENTIC_PLAN.md`
  - `NERVOUS_SYSTEM/50_CORPUS_CAPSULES/qshrink/03_qshrink_agent_sweep_contract.md`
- refreshed manual control surfaces:
  - `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/GLOBAL_EMERGENT_GUILD_HALL/BOARDS/06_QUEST_BOARD.md`
  - `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/06_active_queue.md`
  - `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/nervous_system/manifests/NEXT_SELF_PROMPT.md`
  - `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/ATHENA TEMPLE/MANIFESTS/TEMPLE_STATE.md`
  - `self_actualize/mycelium_brain/GLOBAL_EMERGENT_GUILD_HALL/BOARDS/04_CHANGE_FEED_BOARD.md`

## Agreement check

- `QSHRINK_ACTIVE_FRONT.md` now treats `QS64-19` as current and `QS64-20` as next
- `13_QSHRINK_LOOPED_AGENTIC_PLAN.md` now treats Cloud as the active synchronization pass
- `03_qshrink_agent_sweep_contract.md` now treats Cloud as current and Fractal as next
- Hall board, active queue, Temple state, and next-self prompt now all keep `Q42` open while restoring the shared ordering `Q42 -> QS64-19 -> QS64-20`
- `TQ04` remains the next deeper Temple handoff and is not falsely claimed as landed

## Honest residual

- the Docs gate is still blocked by missing OAuth material
- `QS64-20 Connectivity-Diagnose-Fractal` is not implemented in this pass
- `TQ04` runner-contract binding is still the next deeper Temple frontier

## Restart seed

`Keep Q42 open on QS64-19 Connectivity-Diagnose-Cloud, use the synchronized Cloud control plane to name QS64-20 Connectivity-Diagnose-Fractal as the next Hall restart seed, keep Q02 suppressed while the Docs gate is BLOCKED, and hand the deeper contract-binding pressure to TQ04.`
