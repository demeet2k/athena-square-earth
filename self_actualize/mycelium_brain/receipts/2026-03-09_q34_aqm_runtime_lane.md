# Q34 AQM Runtime Lane Receipt

- Date: `2026-03-09`
- Quest: `Q34 Bind The Promoted AQM Root Into A Replay-Safe Runtime Lane`
- Verdict: `OK`
- Derivation command: `python -m self_actualize.runtime.verify_aqm_runtime_lane`

## Objective

Turn the promoted `AQM` live root from a validated archive promotion into one reusable
runtime lane that another agent can rerun locally.

## Witness

- machine witness:
  `self_actualize/aqm_runtime_lane.json`
- runtime verifier:
  `self_actualize/runtime/verify_aqm_runtime_lane.py`
- wrapper:
  `self_actualize/tools/verify_aqm_runtime_lane.py`
- family root:
  `nervous_system/families/FAMILY_aqm_qphi_live_root.md`
- manifest:
  `nervous_system/manifests/AQM_ACTIVE_FRONT.md`

## Passed Checks

1. `python -m aqm.cli demo`
2. `python -m aqm.apps.planet9.cli --help`

Both commands pass locally from:

`MATH/LIVE_PROMOTED/aqm_kernel_qphi_planet9`

## Law Landed

`AQM` is no longer only a promoted root with proof of extraction.
It is now a replay-safe runtime lane with a stable verifier surface and machine witness.

## Next Seed
