# Siteswap Cross-Synthesis Receipt

Date: 2026-03-09

## Objective

Draft an alternate Chapter 11 that maps siteswap juggling notation to multi-agent pod coordination while grounding the argument in the actual Athena Agent corpus.

## Live Docs Status

Attempted live Google Docs search first through:

- `Trading Bot\docs_search.py`

Result:

- blocked by missing `credentials.json`

## Corpus Scope Used

The synthesis used the existing indexed project surface rather than ad hoc file skimming:

- `559` live atlas records from `self_actualize\corpus_atlas.json`
- `2041` archive-backed records from `self_actualize\archive_atlas.json`

Dominant corpus pattern:

- live surface is manuscript-heavy
- archive surface is code-heavy
- `self_actualize` is the active control plane
- `MATH\FINAL FORM` is the dominant reservoir

## Direct Vocabulary Check

Direct hits across atlas records:

- `siteswap`: `0`
- `sideswap`: `0`
- `multiplex`: `0`
- `juggler`: `0`

Interpretation:

The chapter is not a recovery of an already-indexed local formalism.
It is a lawful bridge chapter that imports juggling as a new coordination grammar and binds it to existing corpus laws.

## Primary Evidence Sources Used

1. `self_actualize\README.md`
   Existing runtime law: route packets, witness bundles, truth lattice, replay-safe writeback.
2. `self_actualize\mycelium_brain\01_crystal_agent_framework.md`
   Existing expansion law from one agent to `4`, `16`, `64`, and `256`.
3. `ECOSYSTEM\12_FRACTAL_CRYSTAL_AGENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
   Existing archetypal and address-lattice framing for recursive agent decomposition.
4. `MATH\FINAL FORM\FRAMEWORKS CODE\Athena OS.zip::athena_os/gin/agents.py`
   Existing multi-agent model with goals, policies, bounded rationality, working memory, and resource layers.
5. `MATH\FINAL FORM\FRAMEWORKS CODE\Athena OS.zip::athena_os/hdcs/controller.py`
   Existing control-tick cadence:
   `Observe -> ModelUpdate -> Propose -> Certify -> Execute -> Audit`
6. `MATH\FINAL FORM\FRAMEWORKS CODE\Athena Tomes.zip::TOME_PROGRAMS/WITNESS_REPLAY_SYSTEM.ts`
   Existing witness, replay, content-addressing, and provenance chain law.
7. `MATH\FINAL FORM\COMPLETE TOMES\Mycelium and structure mapping\MYCELIUM METRO.docx`
   Existing metro-address and typed-edge worldview.

## Cross-Synthesis Result

The corpus already had:

- address law
- route law
- witness law
- audit law
- recursive agent expansion law

What it lacked was:

- a human-native temporal grammar for bounded orchestration

The chapter therefore adds:

- siteswap as pod scheduling algebra
- juggling props as packet-physics taxonomy
- cascade/fountain transitions as governance operations
- drop rate as pod-promotion criterion

## Writeback

Created alternate chapter draft:

- `self_actualize\manuscript_sections\alternates\011_ch11_siteswap_coordination_multi_agent_pod_architecture.md`

Reason for alternate location:

- the current master manuscript already contains another Chapter 11
- placing this draft in a subfolder avoids accidental duplicate merge if the master build script is run later
