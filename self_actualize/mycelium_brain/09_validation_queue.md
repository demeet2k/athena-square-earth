# Validation Queue

## Gate Checks

### Google Docs Gate

- check whether `Trading Bot\credentials.json` exists
- check whether `Trading Bot\token.json` exists
- run `docs_search.py`
- record success or failure
- preserve the exact query and stderr in both `live_docs_gate_status.md` and the receipt surface

### Atlas Integrity Gate

- confirm `corpus_atlas.json` is readable
- confirm `archive_atlas.json` is readable
- confirm merged atlas search still works through `self_actualize\runtime`

### Map Integrity Gate

- confirm all map files exist in `self_actualize\mycelium_brain`
- confirm the metro index points to each core surface
- confirm queue files match the current highest-yield frontier
- confirm `GLOBAL_EMERGENT_GUILD_HALL/00_GUILD_HALL_INDEX.md` exists
- confirm the guild hall boards remain proposal and coordination surfaces rather than drifting into a second canonical cortex

### Toolkit Integrity Gate

- confirm `tool_kit/` exists
- confirm toolkit files `01` through `09` exist
- confirm `registry/00_toolkit_registry.md` references them
- confirm `11_nervous_system_topology.md` points to the toolkit and receipts
- confirm toolkit file `07_tandem_agentic_loop_protocol.md` exists
- confirm toolkit file `08_archive_promotion_protocol.md` exists
- confirm toolkit file `09_cross_agent_contraction_receipt_protocol.md` exists
- confirm `registry/01_tandem_frontier_claims.md` exists and is linked

### Tandem Coordination Gate

- confirm parallel fronts are claimable through `registry/01_tandem_frontier_claims.md`
- confirm new tandem prompt receipt exists
- confirm build queue references the frontier claim law
- confirm contraction receipts can be written without colliding with the frontier claims ledger

### Nervous-System Gate

- confirm `nervous_system/09_parallel_execution_loop.md` exists
- confirm `nervous_system/10_family_frontier_matrix.md` exists
- confirm the active nervous-system index points to both
- confirm family fronts align with the current atlas distribution

### Runtime Gate

- run `python -m self_actualize.runtime.cli` on one new objective
- confirm a route packet is produced
- append findings to `route_quality_ledger.json`

### Holographic Fractal Gate

- confirm `18_holographic_fractal_integration_audit.md` exists
- confirm `19_deepest_self_improvement_plan_256x256.md` exists
- confirm `20_realtime_deeper_enhancement_synthesis.md` exists
- confirm `manifests/HOLOGRAPHIC_FRACTAL_ACTIVE_FRONT.md` exists
- confirm build queue, validation queue, and route-quality ledger reflect the same active front
- confirm the active front touches at least two adjacent scales in the organism

### Realtime Coupling Gate

- confirm a meaningful delta updates at least one witness-bearing surface
- confirm the delta is reflected into center or metro navigation when its meaning changes the organism
- confirm the delta is reflected into build or weakest-front queue when priorities change
- confirm the delta is reflected into validation, manifest, or route ledger when truth or runtime state changes
- confirm the next restart seed still points at the strongest unresolved front

### Guild Hall Gate

- confirm the guild hall index exists
- confirm message, plan, idea, and change boards exist
- confirm guild hall surfaces are linked from the metro index
- confirm the build queue still treats the guild hall as a social coordination membrane rather than an execution waist

## Review Rhythm

### Daily

- one gate check
- one artifact-producing move
- one writeback

### Weekly

- refresh build queue
- refresh metro maps
- refresh validation queue

## Failure Classes

- FAIL: blocked or contradictory with no admissible route
- AMBIG: partial structure but insufficient witness
- NEAR: executable with residuals
- OK: replay-safe enough to commit

## Immediate Checks To Run Next

1. Google Docs auth bootstrap after credentials arrive
2. one archive framework promotion decision
3. one fresh runtime episode logged in the route ledger
4. one toolkit-guided manuscript pass with receipt writeback
5. one archive-promotion rehearsal or live extraction using the canonical protocol
6. one Trading Bot governance-plane bridge into the live nervous-system truth corridor
