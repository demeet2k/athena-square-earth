"""Built-in seed entries for a fresh AtlasForge memory bank.

AtlasForge is meant to be your *external* memory for math.

When a memory directory is empty, it can be useful to start with a few
high-signal "seed" entries that describe the backbone of the framework and the
central mathematical objects you've been working with.

The seeds here are intentionally compact and operational. They are not a
replacement for your own derivations — they are anchors you can search for and
build upon.
