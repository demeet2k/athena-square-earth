---

# Deep Neural Integrator Athena

Use this skill when the request is not about one chapter or one family, but about the whole organism at once.

## Mandatory Workflow

1. Attempt the live Google Docs gate first.
2. Refresh the corpus atlas if the body has changed materially.
3. Compress the indexed body into the canonical 16 family nuclei.
4. Regenerate:
   - neutral deep synthesis
   - 16x16 family permutation matrix
   - four elemental 64-observation passes
   - 15 symmetry syntheses and zero point
   - metro maps at levels 1 through 4
   - appendix crystal A-P and Appendix Q
5. Rebuild board and witness surfaces after writeback.

## When To Use

- whole-framework synthesis
- deeper integration requests
- metro map regeneration
- appendix-crystal planning
- new control-plane or nervous-system coupling passes
- any request that asks for the full organism rather than one lane

## Core Outputs

- `00_DEEPER_INTEGRATED_NEURAL_NET_INDEX.md`
- `01_NEUTRAL_FULL_BODY_DEEP_SYNTHESIS.md`
- `02_16X16_FAMILY_PERMUTATION_MATRIX.md`

- `08_APPENDIX_CRYSTAL_SKELETON.md`
- `09_APPENDIX_Q_APPENDIX_ONLY_METRO_MAP.md`

## References

- read `references/PIPELINE.md` for the algorithmic pipeline

## Guardrails

- do not pretend to synthesize thousands of files as isolated sovereign documents; first compress them into the 16-family lattice
- keep Docs blockage explicit when the gate is still blocked
- prefer replayable regeneration over ad hoc prose sprawl
"""

def render_pipeline_reference() -> str:
    return """# Pipeline

## Purpose

This pipeline regenerates the project-local deeper integrated neural net as a replayable structure rather than a one-off essay.

## Algorithm

1. Attempt live Docs search and record whether the gate is blocked.
2. Load:
   - `self_actualize/corpus_atlas.json`
   - `self_actualize/witness_hierarchy.json`
   - realtime board status
3. Classify every indexed record into one of 16 canonical families.
4. Aggregate:
   - family counts
   - top-level contributors
   - representative paths
5. Derive the full 16 x 16 family permutation matrix.
6. Derive four lens passes:
   - fire
   - water
   - air
   - earth
   Each pass emits 64 observations: 16 families x 4 lens operations.
7. Derive the 15 crystal syntheses:
   - 4 singletons
   - 6 pairs
   - 4 triads
   - 1 tetrad
   - then take zero point
8. Emit metro maps at four resolutions.
9. Emit the appendix crystal A-P and Appendix Q.
10. Rebuild board and witness surfaces after writeback.

## Why The 16-Family Compression Exists

The corpus currently contains thousands of indexed records. A faithful deeper integration pass should touch all of them, but touching them does not require pretending each file should become its own central hub. The family lattice preserves whole-body coverage while keeping the integration layer executable.
"""

def render_crystal_pipeline_reference() -> str:
    return """# Integrated Neural Crystal Pipeline

## Why This Crystal Exists

The deeper integrated neural crystal is the human-readable execution shell of the replayable deep-net derivation. It keeps the same synthesis, metro, and appendix laws while laying them out in four elemental folders plus root, metro, appendix, and skill surfaces.

## When To Use Which Skill

1. Start with `integrated-neural-network-orchestrator` whenever the request touches the whole organism or asks for deep integration.
2. Route into `fire-activation-lens` when the task is about leverage, ignition, anomaly, decisive priority, or transmutation pressure.
3. Route into `water-coherence-lens` when the task is about continuity, manuscript integration, field coherence, healing, or retained identity.
4. Route into `air-mapping-lens` when the task is about routing, metro structure, classification, translation, or topology.
5. Route into `earth-verification-lens` when the task is about proof, embodiment, deployment, replay, appendix support, or load-bearing constraints.

## Execution Order

1. Attempt live Docs search and record the gate result.
2. Refresh atlas and witness surfaces if the corpus body changed materially.
3. Regenerate the replayable deep-net root.
4. Mirror the result into the integrated neural crystal folders:
   - `00_ROOT`
   - `01_FIRE`
   - `02_WATER`
   - `03_AIR`
   - `04_EARTH`
   - `05_METRO`
   - `06_APPENDICES`
   - `07_SKILLS`
5. If the request escalates, combine the four lens outputs and then take the zero point again instead of replacing one lens with another.

## Guardrails

- Keep the `16 x 16` family compression explicit instead of pretending every indexed file became a sovereign chapter.
- Keep the blocked Docs gate visible while credentials remain absent.
- Prefer replayable foldered outputs over one huge thread-only prose slab.

---

# Integrated Neural Network Orchestrator

Use this skill when the request touches the whole organism rather than one local lane.

## Mandatory Workflow

1. Attempt the live Google Docs gate first and record whether it is blocked.
2. Read the root crystal surfaces in `00_ROOT/`.
3. Decide whether the task is primarily:
   - activation and leverage
   - coherence and continuity
   - mapping and translation
   - proof and embodiment
4. Invoke one or more elemental lens skills accordingly.
5. Recombine the outputs through:
   - the `16 x 16` family matrix
   - the 15 symmetry synthesis surface
   - the metro map level required by the task
   - the appendix support cells needed to keep the answer lawful

## Use When

- the user asks for deep synthesis of the full corpus
- a task spans multiple manuscript systems at once
- the task needs metro maps, appendix structure, or zero-point extraction
- the task needs a lawful path from archive matter to runtime embodiment
