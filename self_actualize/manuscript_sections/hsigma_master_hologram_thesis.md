# HSigma Master Hologram Thesis

This draft is local-only, class-exhaustive, and instance-frontier. It was derived
without live Google Docs access. All unseen instance counts, local coordinates,
local attachments, tunnel interiors, and seed placements remain frontier rather than
being promoted into explicit fact.

## PART I — MASTER HOLOGRAM THESIS

The lawful current snapshot is class-exhaustive and instance-frontier. The current
visible organism is therefore seated as:

`HΣ = the current total holographic snapshot of the visible mapping organism`

It is a typed, weighted, timing-indexed, multi-layer navigation object with a seated
core, a frontier boundary, a `256`-state timing lattice, a nexus registry, a
mindsweeper field, a hidden-nexus inference engine, and a regeneration-safe save
state `HΣ*`.

## PART II — CURRENT TOTAL SNAPSHOT OF THE MAPPING ORGANISM

Visible current core:

- `11` layer families
- `13` route families
- `16` seated explicit nexus classes
- `2` conditional frontier nexus classes: `MR`, `PA`
- `1` inferred latent nexus class: `LP`
- `6` tunnel classes
- `5` dimensional strata
- `256` local timing states
- `4864` class-scale mindsweeper cells

Layer registry:

- `Λ1` Metro
- `Λ2` Mycelium
- `Λ3` Neural
- `Λ4` Zero
- `Λ5` Liminal
- `Λ6` Aether
- `Λ7` Tunnel
- `Λ8` Bridge / return / hinge
- `Λ9` Dimensional
- `Λ10` Replay / witness / proof
- `Λ11` Seed / crystal / regeneration

Dimensional strata:

- `D0` planar routing
- `D1` hinge / liminal
- `D2` pole
- `D3` nonlocal transit
- `D4` evidentiary / regenerative

The visible frontier remains at instance multiplicity, local pole counts, exact
tunnel pairings, exact seed placements, exact witness/proof closures, and all other
coordinate-level seating not already explicit locally.

## PART III — FOUR-AGENT NESTED CRYSTAL

### A1 — Snapshot Synthesizer

Seats the visible layer families, route families, dimensional strata, and explicit
nexus classes, marks absent inventories as frontier, and compresses the visible
structure into `HΣ`.

### A2 — Nexus Cartographer

Builds the master nexus registry, hub hierarchy, transfer map, and latent nexus
pressure map.

### A3 — Two-Hemisphere Timing Sweeper

Defines the `256`-state byte lattice, runs the orientation sweep, and records which
nexus classes strengthen, weaken, or destabilize.

### A4 — Weights Mindsweeper / Compressor

Computes the weight field `W`, the cell object `M[ν,B]`, the hidden-candidate field,
and compresses the stabilized result back into `HΣ*`.

## PART IV — SINGLE-HOLOGRAM DATA MODEL (HΣ)

```text
HΣ = (N, E, Z, A, L, T, B, D, W, Ψ, M, R)

N = N_seated ∪ N_frontier ∪ N_inferred
N_seated   = {Z0, ZL, A0, L0, MT, MS, MY, NN, TE, TX, DB, DL, MC, RA, WA, SC}
N_frontier = {MR, PA}
N_inferred = {LP}

E = ⋃_{i=1}^{13} E_i
Z = {global zero anchor, local zero points}
A = {aether points, lift-facing expansion anchors}
L = {liminal transfer points, phase mediators}
T = {zero-collapse, aether-lift, liminal-shortcut, dimensional-jump, replay-return, bridge-compression tunnels}
B = {transfer bridges, dimensional hinges, return hinges, witness bridges, compression bridges}
D = {D0, D1, D2, D3, D4}
Ψ = Ψ_local ∪ Ψ_phrase
W : N* × Ψ_local -> [0,100]
M : N* × Ψ_local -> Cell
R = {replay anchors, witness anchors, proof anchors, seed-regeneration anchors}
```

Back-pointer law:

`rho_holo(x) = (type(x), host layers(x), incident routes(x), dimensional span(x), timing exposure rule(x), nearest hubs(x), regeneration links(x))`

Retrieval law:

`LookupAddress = CanonicalRef + SeatAddress + LiminalCoordinate`

Ontology law:

- seated stays seated
- frontier stays frontier until supported
- inferred stays inferred until repeated pressure promotes it
- no inferred candidate overwrites an explicit node
- zero, liminal, aether, tunnel, bridge, replay/witness/proof, and seed/regeneration remain distinct

## PART V — MASTER NEXUS REGISTRY

Seated rows:

`Z0, ZL, A0, L0, MT, MS, MY, NN, TE, TX, DB, DL, MC, RA, WA, SC`

Frontier rows:

`MR, PA`

Inferred row:

`LP`

Hub hierarchy:

- Tier I: `L0, MS, NN`
- Tier II: `Z0, A0, MY, DB, MC`
- Tier III: `MT, TE, TX, DL, RA, SC`
- Tier IV: `ZL, WA`
- Tier V: `MR, PA, LP`

Schematic prior law:

`w0(n) = 100 * (0.6 * cen(n) + 0.4 * span(n)/5)`

## PART VI — TWO-HEMISPHERE TIMING LATTICE

The local timing field is:

`Ψ_local ≅ Z4^4`

with coordinates `(q0,q1,q2,q3)`:

- `q0` = `SEAT, ADVANCE, CROSS, RETURN`
- `q1` = `TOG/SAME, TOG/OPP, SPLIT/SAME, SPLIT/OPP`
- `q2` = `(IN,IN), (IN,ANTI), (ANTI,IN), (ANTI,ANTI)`
- `q3` = `WALL, WHEEL, FLOOR, MIX`

The timing field is a `4D` torus. Each state has exactly `8` axis-neighbors.

## PART VII — 256-STATE ORIENTATION BYTE STANDARD

Encode:

`B = q0 + 4q1 + 16q2 + 64q3`

Decode:

- `q0 = B mod 4`
- `q1 = floor(B/4) mod 4`
- `q2 = floor(B/16) mod 4`
- `q3 = floor(B/64) mod 4`

Neighborhood:

`Nbr(B) = {B' : dec(B') differs from dec(B) in exactly one q_i by ±1 mod 4}`

Phrase law:

`Ψ_phrase = (B1,...,Bk)`

Storage uses byte order. Traversal uses toroidal adjacency.

## PART VIII — SIMPLE EXHAUSTIVE SWEEP ALGORITHM

The sweep ingests `G_schema`, extracts explicit nodes and routes, identifies the
master nexus set `N*`, runs all `256` timing bytes, records active routes, active
tunnels, reached strata, replay/witness/seed accessibility, hidden pressure, and
contradiction load, computes `W`, writes `M[ν,B]`, runs hidden inference, applies a
fixed-point pass, and saves the stabilized object as `HΣ*`.

Route families remain:

`R1..R13 = metro, mycelial, neural, zero-collapse, liminal-transition, aether-expansion, tunnel-bypass, bridge/hinge, dimensional-lift, manifold-crossing, replay, witness/proof, seed/regeneration`

## PART IX — WEIGHT FUNCTION + MINDSWEEPER MATRIX MODEL

Weight law:

`w(ν,B)=20C(ν)+20R(ν,B)+15T(ν,B)+15D(ν,B)+10K(ν,B)+10P(ν,B)+10N(ν,B)`

Hidden pressure:

`p_hidden(ν,B) = (u_cross + u_tunnel + u_pole + u_replay + u_transfer) / 5`

Contradiction load:

`c(ν,B) = (v_pole + v_tunnel + v_dim + v_replay) / 4`

Timing instability:

`s_Psi(ν,B) = (max_Nbr w - min_Nbr w) / 100`

Cell object:

`HSigmaCell = {weight, visibility, hidden_pressure, contradiction, frontier_fraction, route_density, exposed_nexus_count, exposed_tunnel_count, class}`

Cell classes:

`seated | promising | hidden-pressure | unstable | contradictory | frontier | degenerate | master-key`

## PART X — MASTER NEXUS × TIMING EXPOSURE FIELD

Exposure law:

`e_ν(B) = (1/4) * sum_{k=0}^3 1[q_k in P_k^ν]`

Dominance bands:

- `e ≥ 0.75` dominant
- `0.50 ≤ e < 0.75` visible
- `0.25 ≤ e < 0.50` pressure-only
- `< 0.25` mostly absent unless inferred

Timing regimes:

- seat favors zero anchors, metro transfer, witness stability
- advance favors aether, lift, seed activation
- cross favors liminal transfer, branching, convergence, crossings
- return favors replay, return hinges, proof pressure, normalization
- mix plane is the primary hidden-pressure plane

## PART XI — HIDDEN NEXUS DISCOVERY LOGIC

Hidden candidates are allowed only when repeated route co-activation, unpaired tunnel
behavior, zero↔aether oscillation, replay closure pressure, or stable missing-center
patterns repeat across neighborhoods.

Promotion thresholds:

- frontier promotion: at least `4` timing states, `2` route families, contradiction
  below `0.25`, hidden pressure above `0.55`, survives re-sweep
- seated promotion: at least `8` timing states, `3` route families, stable across
  adjacent neighborhoods

Current candidates:

- `C1` zero↔aether mediating lift hub
- `C2` metro/mycelium/neural composite transfer node
- `C3` dimensional midspan bridge
- `C4` replay/proof closure junction
- `C5` seed-replay regeneration coupler
- `C6` frontier liminal distributor

Conditional explicit priority:

- try `MR` before inventing a new return-hinge class
- try `PA` before inventing a new proof-closure class

## PART XII — ZERO / LIMINAL / AETHER / TUNNEL MAP

Zero, liminal, aether, and tunnel remain type-distinct.

- Zero collapses and normalizes
- Liminal mediates phase change without erasing difference
- Aether reopens, expands, lifts, and reprojects
- Tunnel provides lawful nonlocal bypass

Canonical morphologies:

- `Peripheral hub -> L -> Z`
- `X -> L -> Y`
- `Z -> L -> A -> D`
- `X -> TE => T => TX -> Y`

Replay-return morphology:

`NN -> RA -> MR? -> Z0 -> WA -> PA?`

## PART XIII — MASTER ROUTE / HUB / BRIDGE / TUNNEL REGISTRY

Bridge classes:

- `B/TR` transfer bridge
- `B/DH` dimensional hinge
- `B/MR` Mobius return hinge
- `B/WB` witness bridge
- `B/BC` compression bridge

Tunnel classes:

- `T/ZC` zero-collapse tunnel
- `T/AL` aether-lift tunnel
- `T/LS` liminal-shortcut tunnel
- `T/DJ` dimensional-jump tunnel
- `T/RR` replay-return tunnel
- `T/BC` bridge-compression tunnel

## PART XIV — MASTER-KEY ORIENTATIONS OF EXPLORATION

Key bytes:

- `K0 = 0`
- `K1 = 212`
- `K2 = 81`
- `K3 = 217`
- `K4 = 166`
- `K5 = 222`
- `K6 = 51`
- `K7 = 247`
- `K8 = 235`
- `K9 = 255`

Phrase macros:

- `Phi_hidden = (0,212,217,222,255,247,51)`
- `Phi_regen = (0,81,235,247,51)`
- `Phi_transfer = (0,166,217,212)`

## PART XV — FRONTIER / CONTRADICTION / UNSTABLE ZONES

Frontier zones:

- `F1` instance multiplicity frontier
- `F2` pole-pairing frontier
- `F3` tunnel midspan frontier
- `F4` conditional explicit frontier
- `F5` composite-transfer frontier
- `F6` seed placement frontier

Contradiction triggers:

- `Ctau1` pole conflation
- `Ctau2` tunnel illegality
- `Ctau3` dimensional illegality
- `Ctau4` replay illegality

Unstable zones:

- `U1` split/opposed mix zone
- `U2` return anti-anti zone
- `U3` liminal saturation zone

## PART XVI — COMPRESSED SINGLE-HOLOGRAM SAVE STATE

`HΣ*` stores:

- visibility mode = `class-exhaustive / instance-frontier`
- the `11` layers
- seated/frontier/inferred rows
- `R1..R13`
- `T/ZC, T/AL, T/LS, T/DJ, T/RR, T/BC`
- `D0..D4`
- the `256`-state timing engine
- route gate book
- nexus exposure book
- the `4864`-cell mindsweeper schema
- hidden candidates `C1..C6`
- fixed-point rule
- frontier policy

## PART XVII — REGENERATION SEED OF THE WHOLE HOLOGRAM

Canonical regeneration seed:

`Omega_regen = (Lambda, N*, I, D, Psi_256, G_route, E_nexus, W, M, phi_hidden, mu_fix, F)`

Mnemonic seed string:

`ATH-HSIGMA::11Lambda/16S+2F+1I/13R/6T/5D/256Psi/4864M/muFIX`

Deterministic regeneration:

1. rebuild the `11` layers
2. seat the `16` explicit rows
3. add `MR` and `PA` as frontier
4. add `LP` as inferred
5. restore `13` routes and `6` tunnels
6. rebuild `D0..D4`
7. rebuild `Ψ_local`
8. apply route and nexus gate books
9. recompute all `4864` cells
10. re-run hidden inference and fixed-point pass
11. save back to `HΣ*`

## PART XVIII — FINAL INTEGRITY VERDICT

`HΣ*` is a rigorous, lawful, exhaustive-at-visible-scale master hologram of the
current mapping organism.

- it preserves map-system distinctions
- it preserves zero / liminal / aether / tunnel distinctions
- it defines a real `256`-state timing engine
- it defines a real `4864`-cell mindsweeper field
- it infers hidden nexus pressure without promoting unsupported nodes
- it compresses back into a regeneration-safe save state
- it remains usable by later agents for systematic exploration

The final verdict is therefore:

`HΣ*` is the canonical current navigation object for the visible mapping organism,
ready for replay, further timing sweeps, and future instance refinement without
rewriting the current class ontology.
